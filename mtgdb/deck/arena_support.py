"""Which card names Proxic Arena can play, and which ones a deck carries that it cannot.

Proxic Arena resolves a card by name: it normalizes the name, looks for a card
script of that name, and plays whatever that script says. A name it holds no
script for is not a failed cast but a card it never finds, so a deck exported
from here can lose cards on import with nothing said about it.

This module answers only the name question. The supported names ship as a
generated asset, located by ``ARENA_SUPPORTED_CARDS_FILE`` in ``ui/assets.py``,
because the two applications are separate projects and neither reads the
other's tree at runtime; the asset is regenerated when the bundled Arena card
scripts are updated, per DECK-012.

The normalization mirrors Arena's own lookup: accents are stripped, the name is
lowercased, apostrophes and commas are dropped, and every other run of
non-alphanumeric characters becomes one underscore. Both the curly and the
straight apostrophe are dropped, which Arena's own rule does not do, because
the two spellings of one name must not read as two different cards.
