"""Bundled-asset location and PIL availability shared by UI modules.

Assets live in the repository-root ``assets/`` directory when running from
source, and under the PyInstaller ``_MEIPASS`` tree when frozen. Both the app
shell and the window-services mixin resolve bundled files through here so the
lookup rule has a single owner. Mana rendering also consumes the exported PIL
handles from this module rather than probing Pillow independently.
