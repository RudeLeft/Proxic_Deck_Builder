"""Bundle one deck as a Proxic Arena import: its decklist plus its card art.

Proxic Arena renders a card from real art only when it already has the file:
its client indexes `client/assets/real_cards/*.png` by card name, so a deck
that arrives as a bare decklist plays through the generated fallback art. This
module packages the two together -- the decklist Arena loads and the PNGs its
client indexes -- as one zip:

    <DeckName>.txt
    real_cards/<Card Name> [SET].png

The names follow Arena's own index rule (`_real_art_path` in its client): the
trailing `[SET]` is stripped and what remains is matched against the card name,
lowercased, with no accent folding. So accents are kept exactly as printed, and
only characters a filesystem refuses are removed. That index is keyed by name
alone, which means two printings of one name would collide in it, so this
bundles ONE image per distinct card name rather than per printing.

The PNGs come from `printing/service.py`, which already downloads, validates,
caches and atomically replaces Scryfall's high-quality PNG per exact printing,
including a separate image per face of a double-faced card. Nothing here
re-downloads what printing has already cached.
