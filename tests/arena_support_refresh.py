"""Regenerate assets/arena/supported_cards.json from the Proxic Arena card scripts.

Proxic Arena resolves a card by name alone, so the Deck Builder can only warn
about a card Arena will not find if it holds the list of names Arena has card
scripts for. The two applications are separate projects and neither reads the
other's tree at runtime, so that list ships as a generated asset and is
refreshed by this script whenever the Arena card scripts are updated
(DECK-012).

This is a maintenance tool, not a gate: it reads a tree outside this
repository and rewrites a source asset, so it is deliberately named outside the
`test_*.py` pattern the release suite runs. `tests/test_deck_architecture.py`
checks its contract without needing the Arena tree, the way
`test_taxonomy_audit_contract.py` does for the taxonomy audit.

Usage, from the project root. The card scripts' location is always given, since
nothing in this repository may depend on where another project keeps its files:

    python tests/arena_support_refresh.py --cardsfolder <path to cardsfolder>
    python tests/arena_support_refresh.py --cardsfolder <path> --check

`--check` writes nothing and exits nonzero when the shipped asset no longer
matches the scripts, which is the question to ask after bumping Arena.
