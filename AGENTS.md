# Proxic Deck Builder — Agent Operating Contract

This file is the complete and authoritative operating contract for every AI
agent and developer who inspects, changes, tests, builds, or packages this
project. It is the single source of truth: where code lives, what each module
owns, what may import what, how to name and place new code, and how every
change is verified. It contains current rules only.

Read it top to bottom before your first change. The five navigation sections —
**Repository map**, **Feature map**, **Module ownership**, **Module map**, and
**Import allow/deny matrix** — provide the routing index for locating an owner
before an edit. When a request names a feature ("change search", "fix the mana curve"),
start with that Feature-map row, use Module ownership to choose the file that
owns the behavior, and use the import matrix before crossing a boundary.

## Authority and interpretation

Normative terms have fixed meanings:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **MUST** | Mandatory. Failure blocks completion and release. |
| **MUST NOT** | Prohibited. Violation blocks completion and release. |
| **SHOULD** | Required default. Departure requires the user's explicit approval. |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Prohibited default. Departure requires the user's explicit approval. |
| **MAY** | Optional within all other rules. |

Every enforceable rule has a unique ID and one verification class:

| Class | Evidence required |
| --- | --- |
| **AUTO** | A deterministic test or packaging check must pass. |
| **WINDOWS** | A deterministic check must pass on Windows. |
| **REVIEW** | The agent must inspect the affected source or diff and report the result accurately. |
| **MANUAL** | A person must exercise and visually inspect the affected interface. |
| **USER** | The user must explicitly approve the exception or decision. |

- **GOV-001 — MUST:** Read this file completely before inspecting, planning,
  editing, testing, building, or packaging. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **GOV-002 — MUST:** Treat every MUST/MUST NOT as a release blocker when it
  governs the changed files or release type. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **GOV-003 — MUST:** When the user's explicit instruction changes a project
  decision, update the affected rule and any affected navigation table in this
  file in the same change, so the repository keeps one current source of truth.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **GOV-004 — MUST:** Stop before implementation when a request conflicts with
  an unchanged rule, name the exact rule ID, and obtain explicit user approval
  for the exception or rule change. _Verification:_ **USER**.
- **GOV-005 — MUST NOT:** Claim a test, platform check, visual review, or user
  approval occurred unless it actually occurred. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **GOV-006 — MUST:** Demonstrate AUTO/WINDOWS compliance by successful command
  exit status, not by assertion. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **GOV-007 — MUST:** Refuse delivery and packaging while any governing
  mandatory rule has a known violation or failed verification.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.

## Repository map

The project is one importable package, `mtgdb`, organized **layer-first**: all
presentation lives under `mtgdb/ui/`, and each non-UI concern is its own
domain package. This makes the project's central invariant physical — see
LAYER-001.

## Feature map

Each row lists the owning files and direct collaborators a change to that feature
should inspect first. Presentation files are under `mtgdb/ui/`; the rest are
Tk-free logic. The table is a routing index, not a transitive dependency dump:
Module ownership decides where behavior belongs and the import matrix decides
which dependency directions are legal.

| Feature | Presentation | Logic / data |

Data-shape routing: when a Search or configurable Results/Table request needs a card field that is not already stored, inspect `mtgdb/database/schema.py` and `mtgdb/database/bulk_import.py` first, then update the Search/table owners. UI or Search modules must not synthesize a missing stored Scryfall field.

Taxonomy routing: selectable Search vocabulary comes from `mtgdb/database/taxonomy.py` and the current local Scryfall snapshot. Scryfall catalogs authorize Card Types, Subtypes, and Mechanics; Supertypes are authorized by a strictly parsed, provenance-recorded current Wizards Comprehensive Rules TXT discovered from the official Rules page; observed Scryfall row fields authorize Sets, Set Types, Formats, and Rarities. Every picker taxonomy value must be both upstream-authorized and present in the current local Content/Paper scope. UI/workspace code may select existing vocabulary but may not create it.

## Module ownership

Each module has one exclusive responsibility. A fact about behavior X is edited
only in the module that owns X.

| Module | Exclusive responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `mtgdb/__main__.py` | Module entry point that delegates `python -m mtgdb` to `main.main()` |
| `mtgdb/main.py` | Startup, logging, single-instance handling, portable runtime-directory init |
| `mtgdb/ui/app.py` | Main-window composition, cross-feature state, shared services, mixin assembly and compatibility delegation |

| `mtgdb/core/scryfall_json.py` | Shared parsing of Scryfall JSON list columns (notably `card_faces`) that bulk import stores as text |
| `mtgdb/core/secret_store.py` | Keeping a small secret on disk sealed to the Windows user (DPAPI), or owner-only where DPAPI does not exist |
| `mtgdb/core/net.py` | Scryfall HTTP behavior, headers, throttling, transient retries, declared-length verification, partial cleanup |
| `mtgdb/core/background_jobs.py` | Shared cancellation exception, cooperative cancel check, daemon-thread factory, and generation-tagged single-worker controller for printing and syncing |
| `mtgdb/core/atomic_files.py` | Shared temporary-file naming for atomic writes and the sweep that removes temporaries a killed process left behind |
| `mtgdb/core/version.py` | Single runtime source for the application version (installed/frozen distribution metadata -- the highest version when an additive update left older `dist-info` folders beside the new one -- falling back to `pyproject.toml`) |
| `mtgdb/core/update_check.py` | Pure version parsing/compare and latest-GitHub-release selection, dependency-injected (no Tk, no direct network) |
| `mtgdb/core/self_update.py` | Release-asset and checksums-asset selection, download verification (sha256 from digest or `SHA256SUMS.txt`, plus structure), staging/extraction, pending/apply markers and the post-update health flag, and the on-restart backup + swap + health-gated rollback script; preserves `data\` (no Tk, no direct network) |
| `mtgdb/core/format_names.py` | The single mapping from Scryfall format key to readable format name, shared by the Format picker, the card preview, and the deck legality report |
| `mtgdb/search/models.py` | Immutable search criteria, signatures, worker events, result contracts |
| `mtgdb/search/repository.py` | Interactive-search DB gateway, narrow projection, name suggestions, filter catalogs |

| `mtgdb/search/catalogs.py` | Bounded Content/Platform/Paper/Set-Type trusted-taxonomy snapshot caches and latest-wins background catalog discovery |
| `mtgdb/search/context.py` | Tk-free latest-wins live draft Search analysis: predictive self-excluding facet counts, numeric ranges, existing-property counts, cancellation/cache, and zero-result relaxation suggestions |
| `mtgdb/search/facet_index.py` | Tk-free in-memory per-value bitset facet index: byte-identical bitset predicates mirroring SearchQueryBuilder for near-real-time contextual counts (including format legality, numeric ranges, default mana-symbol color presence, and free-text name/rules search scanned per query over stored name/oracle corpora), built once and warmable off the request path, with fallback only for an explicit mana-symbol minimum it cannot represent |
| `mtgdb/deck/model.py` | Exact-printing deck state, quantities, board mutations, entry access, compat delegation |
| `mtgdb/deck/io.py` | Portable TXT serialization, atomic user-selected TXT save, section parsing, printing tags, resolver import |
| `mtgdb/deck/file_jobs.py` | Tk-free daemon submission wrapper for deck import/save/export file work |

| `mtgdb/deck/arena_support.py` | The normalized Proxic Arena card-name key, reading Arena's deck rules document (the cards and printings it plays in the order it prefers them, the set codes it accepts, its format's limits), and deciding which of a deck's names Proxic Arena cannot play |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_limits.py` | Measuring a deck against Arena's format as its rules state it -- the deck's size, copies per name with only the listed basic lands exempt, the Contraption and Attraction side decks -- and finding the legendary permanents a deck holds more than once |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_tokens.py` | Dividing a deck into its cards, its token cards (sent as pictures) and its emblems and art cards (left out); finding which tokens the deck's cards make, from Scryfall related parts, and which have no token card in the deck |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_printings.py` | Deciding whether Proxic Arena accepts a card's printing by its rules, and which printing it has to send instead: same set first, then the first in Arena's order Scryfall can picture, else the name alone |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_check.py` | One detached deck checked against Arena's rules for the export window: its parts, the printings it goes in, its limits, unplayable cards and token pictures, and whether Arena would refuse it |
| `mtgdb/arena/export.py` | Proxic Arena package contents: the art filename Arena indexes, one image per distinct card name and token, the pictures Arena already holds left out, and the zip built in memory |
| `mtgdb/arena/connection.py` | This computer's link to a Proxic Arena: the Arena address rule, trading a one-time code for a device token, keeping the link and its sealed token, downloading the deck rules and choosing between the fresh, saved and built-in copies, reading the player's deck names, asking which pictures Arena holds, and sending a deck |
| `mtgdb/database/authorities.py` | Declarative registry of upstream Scryfall catalogs the application understands, their semantic roles, subtype applicability, and compatibility metadata keys; never value whitelists |
| `mtgdb/database/constants.py` | Shared database/search semantics: colors, trusted content classes, known/playable legality statuses, known layout classes, and preferred rarity display order |
| `mtgdb/database/db.py` | Stable `CardDB` façade, metadata/catalog composition, lifecycle delegation, public API |
| `mtgdb/database/schema.py` | Schema version, columns, indexes, precomputed search columns/masks, type/subtype/keyword membership tables, connection policy, corrupt-database quarantine and rebuild, query-function registration, migration |
| `mtgdb/database/semantics.py` | Rules normalization, type-line repair, phrase-safe type/subtype matching, stable Cards/Tokens/Emblems/Art Series classification plus internal unknown-layout classification, SQLite semantic functions |
| `mtgdb/database/bulk_import.py` | Row projection (including precomputed search columns and type/subtype/keyword membership rows), strict streaming JSON/JSONL/gzip parsing, transactional bulk replacement, distinct-row threshold protection, index rebuild |
| `mtgdb/database/queries.py` | Exact-printing lookup, every printing of one name, import-resolver ranking, and name suggestions |
| `mtgdb/database/search_queries.py` | `SearchQueryBuilder`, canonical parameterized search SQL over precomputed columns (content_kind, colour bitmasks, packed trait flags) and type/subtype/keyword membership tables, projection validation, stable `CardDB.search()` implementation |
| `mtgdb/database/taxonomy.py` | Trusted observed Search vocabulary plus internal upstream compatibility fingerprints/reports: sets, set types, formats, rarities, catalog-backed Card Types/Subtypes/Mechanics, and Wizards-rules-backed Supertypes, scoped by Content and Paper-only |
| `mtgdb/database/sync.py` | Tk-free Scryfall bulk/catalog retrieval plus official Wizards Rules TXT discovery/parsing/provenance, 48-hour/taxonomy-completeness due policy, internal post-refresh compatibility diagnostics, download cleanup, progress, cancellation, single-worker lifecycle, typed events |

## Module map

Use this task-oriented map after the Feature map identifies the feature. The
Module ownership table states the exclusive responsibility; this map gives
concrete routing examples, the nearest collaborators to inspect, and a boundary
cue that prevents convenient-but-wrong placement. Examples are representative,
not exhaustive: inspect the current implementation and governing rules before
editing. Every non-empty production module must appear exactly once and must
have at least two routing examples.

| Module | Route here for examples | Usually inspect with | Boundary cue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mtgdb/__main__.py` | change `python -m mtgdb` delegation<br>change module-entry exit forwarding | `mtgdb/main.py` | Do not add startup policy or feature logic here. |

| `mtgdb/ui/app.py` | add or replace a shared application service<br>change mixin composition, top-level shell wiring, or cross-feature delegation | `mtgdb/main.py`; owning `mtgdb/ui/*.py` feature module | Keep feature-specific behavior in its owning feature module. |
| `mtgdb/core/cache_names.py` | change collision-safe cache filenames<br>change cache identity/index path construction | `mtgdb/images/service.py`; `mtgdb/printing/service.py` | Do not download, decode, or render images here. |

Card semantics, image selection, and display formatting stay with their owners. |
| `mtgdb/core/secret_store.py` | change how a stored secret is sealed to the Windows user<br>change what an unreadable or foreign sealed file reads as | `mtgdb/arena/connection.py`; `mtgdb/ui/arena_connection.py` | Sealing bytes only: what the secret is and when it is used belong to its caller. |

| `mtgdb/core/atomic_files.py` | change atomic-write temporary naming<br>change which abandoned temporaries a writer sweeps | `mtgdb/workspace/repository.py`; `mtgdb/preferences/repository.py`; `mtgdb/deck/io.py` | Naming and cleanup only: the writers keep their own payload semantics, and a sweep never removes a file this application did not name. |
| `mtgdb/core/version.py` | change how the runtime application version is resolved, including which of several bundled `dist-info` versions wins<br>change the distribution-metadata vs `pyproject.toml` fallback order | `mtgdb/main.py`; `mtgdb/ui/app.py`; `mtgdb/core/self_update.py` | Read-only version resolution; no Tk, SQL, or feature logic. The in-app swap is additive and never purges, so stale older metadata beside the new must never win. |
| `mtgdb/core/update_check.py` | change version parsing or the newer-than comparison<br>change latest-release selection or the release feed URL | `mtgdb/ui/updates.py`; `mtgdb/core/net.py` | Pure and dependency-injected: no Tk and no direct network; the caller supplies the fetcher. |

| `mtgdb/deck/model.py` | change card quantity or board-move invariants<br>change exact-printing deck entry identity/access behavior | `mtgdb/deck/io.py`; `mtgdb/deck/sessions.py`; `mtgdb/ui/deck.py` | File formats, UI callbacks, and legality rules have separate owners. |
| `mtgdb/deck/io.py` | change portable TXT syntax or printing tags<br>change atomic TXT save, section parsing, or resolver-driven import | `mtgdb/deck/model.py`; `mtgdb/database/queries.py`; `mtgdb/ui/deck_files.py` | Do not open Tk dialogs or own database ranking here. |
| `mtgdb/deck/file_jobs.py` | change daemon execution/future completion for deck import/save/export work<br>change background exception propagation for deck file jobs | `mtgdb/core/background_jobs.py`; `mtgdb/ui/deck_files.py` | Never import Tk or own deck format semantics; this is execution plumbing only. |
| `mtgdb/deck/analysis.py` | change mana curve/type/source statistics<br>change draw probability or sample-hand calculations | `mtgdb/ui/deck_stats.py`; `mtgdb/deck/model.py` | Keep presentation and format-legality policy out of analysis. |
| `mtgdb/deck/legality.py` | change verified format deck-size/sideboard rules or unsupported-format behavior<br>change copy-limit, legality-payload normalization, banned/restricted/not-legal, or missing-status checks | `mtgdb/ui/deck_stats.py`; `mtgdb/ui/card_detail.py`; `mtgdb/database/constants.py` | This is a basic legality engine, not UI or general deck statistics; its format profiles MUST NOT authorize Search Format vocabulary. |
| `mtgdb/deck/sessions.py` | change active-deck switching/default-session rules<br>change dirty-state or open-session lifecycle | `mtgdb/deck/model.py`; `mtgdb/ui/deck.py`; `mtgdb/ui/workspace.py` | Do not persist workspace files or manipulate widgets here. |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_support.py` | change which names count as playable in Proxic Arena<br>change how a decklist is checked against the Proxic Arena card pool<br>change how Arena's deck rules document is read | `mtgdb/ui/arena_export.py`; `mtgdb/arena/connection.py`; `mtgdb/deck/model.py` | Reading and name keys only: fetching and saving the rules belong to the connection, which printing is exported to arena printings, and the notice's wording to the Arena export UI; nothing here judges format legality or deck construction outside Arena. |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_limits.py` | change how a deck is measured against Arena's card count or copy limit<br>change how the Contraption and Attraction side decks are counted for the export<br>change which repeated legendary cards Proxic Arena export warns about | `mtgdb/ui/arena_export.py`; `mtgdb/deck/arena_support.py`; `mtgdb/deck/model.py` | Measurement only: the numbers come from Arena's rules document, the refusal's wording and dialog belong to the Arena export UI, and the name key to arena support. |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_tokens.py` | change which tokens a deck's cards are listed as able to create<br>change how token related parts are read from stored card data for the Arena export<br>change which deck entries travel as token pictures or are left out | `mtgdb/ui/arena_export.py`; `mtgdb/core/scryfall_json.py`; `mtgdb/deck/arena_support.py` | Finding only: the notice's wording and list belong to the Arena export UI, and parsing a stored JSON column belongs to the shared Scryfall parser. |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_printings.py` | change which printing a Proxic Arena send uses when Arena lacks the deck's own<br>change how a card's set code and collector number are checked against the printings Arena has | `mtgdb/ui/arena_export.py`; `mtgdb/deck/arena_support.py`; `mtgdb/database/queries.py` | Choosing only, and only for the export: the asset belongs to arena support, the card database is read through an injected lookup, the swap list's wording belongs to the Arena export UI, and the saved deck is never changed. |
| `mtgdb/deck/arena_check.py` | change what the export window measures about a deck<br>change which problems keep a deck from being sent | `mtgdb/ui/arena_export.py`; `mtgdb/deck/arena_limits.py`; `mtgdb/deck/arena_tokens.py`; `mtgdb/deck/arena_printings.py` | Gathering only: each measurement belongs to its own module, and the words to the export window. |
| `mtgdb/arena/export.py` | change the art filename Proxic Arena looks up or which printing supplies one name's image<br>change what the package holds or which pictures are left out of it | `mtgdb/ui/arena_export.py`; `mtgdb/printing/service.py`; `mtgdb/deck/model.py` | The card-art download, its cache and its HTTP policy stay in printing and are injected here; this owns naming and packaging only. |
| `mtgdb/arena/connection.py` | change how this computer links to Proxic Arena or stores its device token<br>change when the deck rules are downloaded or which saved copy the check falls back to<br>change how a deck is sent or how Arena's answer to a send is read | `mtgdb/ui/arena_connection.py`; `mtgdb/ui/arena_export.py`; `mtgdb/core/secret_store.py` | Transport and storage only: it reads no rule (the caller passes the check), draws nothing, and never follows a redirect with the token. |
| `mtgdb/database/authorities.py` | change which Scryfall catalogs/concepts this build understands<br>change subtype-family applicability or compatibility metadata keys | `mtgdb/database/sync.py`; `mtgdb/database/taxonomy.py`; `mtgdb/database/schema.py` | Registry entries describe authority semantics only; never add Card Type/Subtype/Mechanic values here and never auto-interpret an unknown endpoint. |
| `mtgdb/database/constants.py` | change color/content/layout vocabulary<br>change known/playable-legality semantics or preferred rarity ordering | `mtgdb/database/search_queries.py`; `mtgdb/database/taxonomy.py`; `mtgdb/database/semantics.py`; `mtgdb/deck/legality.py` | Do not hardcode allowed Card Types, Supertypes, set groupings, Subtypes, Mechanics, Formats, Sets, Set Types, or Rarity membership here. Familiar rarity values MAY define display order only when unknown observed rarities remain accepted. |
| `mtgdb/database/db.py` | add or change a stable public `CardDB` façade method<br>change database mixin composition or connection/lifecycle delegation | `mtgdb/database/schema.py`; `mtgdb/database/queries.py`; `mtgdb/database/search_queries.py`; `mtgdb/database/taxonomy.py` | Do not implement SQL/query algorithms directly in the façade. |
| `mtgdb/database/schema.py` | add a stored card column or index<br>change schema migration, connection policy, corrupt-database recovery on open, or SQLite function registration | `mtgdb/database/bulk_import.py`; `mtgdb/database/semantics.py`; query owners | Do not parse Scryfall payloads or build UI here. |

Do not guess words or accept workspace/UI values as vocabulary. |
| `mtgdb/database/sync.py` | change the 48-hour/taxonomy-completeness refresh-due policy, Scryfall bulk/catalog flow, or Wizards Rules TXT discovery/parsing/provenance<br>change sync cancellation, progress events, download cleanup, or single-worker lifecycle | `mtgdb/core/net.py`; `mtgdb/core/background_jobs.py`; `mtgdb/database/bulk_import.py`; `mtgdb/ui/database_sync.py` | No Tk dialogs and no direct Search-controller manipulation here. |
| `mtgdb/comparison/models.py` | change comparison minimum/maximum or add/remove semantics<br>change exact-printing ordering, normalization, or mutation-result behavior | `mtgdb/ui/comparison_controls.py`; `mtgdb/ui/comparison.py` | Keep window/image presentation out of the comparison domain. |

| `mtgdb/printing/renderer.py` | change physical card/page dimensions or page grid<br>change PDF image placement, cut borders, page counting, or atomic PDF output | `mtgdb/printing/service.py`; `mtgdb/ui/printing.py` | Do not download/cache images, inspect deck state, or manage workers here. |

| `mtgdb/ui/autocomplete.py` | change autocomplete popup keyboard/focus/dismissal mechanics<br>change `AutocompleteEntry` suggestion/commit behavior | `mtgdb/ui/components.py`; consuming Search UI | Keep popup mechanics centralized; do not duplicate them in individual screens. |

| `mtgdb/search/facet_index.py` | change the in-memory bitset predicates or which filters are bitset-representable<br>change contextual count/relaxation computation over the bitset index | `mtgdb/search/context.py`; `mtgdb/database/search_queries.py`; `mtgdb/database/semantics.py` | Tk-free only; bitset predicates MUST stay byte-identical to SearchQueryBuilder, verified against count_search, and fall back to the SQLite worker for anything not representable. |

| `mtgdb/ui/search_checklist.py` | change searchable taxonomy/format/rarity choice behavior<br>change hidden-first fixed-row virtualization, filtering, selection, columns, or dismissal | `mtgdb/ui/search.py`; `mtgdb/ui/components.py` | Keep logical values in Python and the physical choice-widget pool bounded; single-select choices use radio controls; table-column filters use `ui/table_filters.py`. |

## Import allow/deny matrix

Read this before adding any import. It consolidates every cross-boundary rule.
The **MAY import** column lists allowed project-layer and relevant third-party
dependencies; Python standard-library imports and sibling modules within
`mtgdb/ui/` are allowed unless a row explicitly forbids them. More-specific
rows override broader rows.

### UI feature clusters

The `mtgdb/ui/**` row above permits any owning `mtgdb` API, which leaves the
largest layer without internal dependency direction. Each `mtgdb/ui/` module
therefore belongs to exactly one cluster below and reaches Tk-free logic only
through that cluster's packages, plus `mtgdb.core.*`. Sibling `mtgdb.ui.*`
imports stay unrestricted. `mtgdb/ui/app.py` is the composition root that wires
every feature together and is exempt.

| Cluster | UI modules | MAY import |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Search | `search.py`, `search_filters.py`, `search_printings.py`, `search_checklist.py`, `set_filters.py`, `table_filters.py`, `results.py`, `tables.py`, `autocomplete.py` | `mtgdb.search.`, `mtgdb.database.constants`, `mtgdb.preferences.` |
| Deck | `deck.py`, `deck_files.py`, `deck_stats.py` | `mtgdb.deck.` |
| Arena export | `arena_export.py`, `arena_connection.py` | `mtgdb.arena.`, `mtgdb.deck.`, `mtgdb.printing.` |
| Comparison | `comparison.py`, `comparison_controls.py` | `mtgdb.comparison.`, `mtgdb.images.` |
| Card detail | `card_detail.py` | `mtgdb.images.`, `mtgdb.deck.legality`, `mtgdb.database.constants` |
| Printing | `printing.py` | `mtgdb.printing.` |
| Database sync | `database_sync.py` | `mtgdb.database.` |
| Workspace | `workspace.py` | `mtgdb.workspace.`, `mtgdb.deck.` |
| Updates | `updates.py` | — |
| Shared presentation | `tokens.py`, `components.py`, `styles.py`, `assets.py`, `window.py`, `mana.py` | — |

- **LAYER-001 — MUST:** Import `tkinter` (or build a Tk widget/image) only from
  modules under `mtgdb/ui/`. No module outside `mtgdb/ui/` imports `tkinter`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAYER-002 — MUST NOT:** Import any `mtgdb.ui.*` module from a non-UI
  package. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAYER-003 — MUST NOT:** Import `sqlite3` or construct SQL in any `mtgdb.ui.*`
  module. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAYER-004 — MUST:** Obey the specific MAY/MUST NOT rows above for every
  added import. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAYER-005 — MUST NOT:** Import a feature package from `mtgdb/core/**`; core
  is the shared base and depends on nothing above it. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAYER-006 — MUST:** Assign every `mtgdb/ui/` module to exactly one row of
  the UI feature-cluster table, and import Tk-free logic only from that row's
  packages plus `mtgdb.core.*`. A cluster reaching into another feature's logic
  package — a mana-symbol module importing the PDF renderer — is a boundary
  break even where the broad `mtgdb/ui/**` row would permit it. Sibling
  `mtgdb.ui.*` imports remain unrestricted. `mtgdb/ui/app.py` is exempt as the
  composition root, and the empty `mtgdb/ui/__init__.py` holds no imports to
  place. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-037 — MUST:** Offer `None` beside `Any`/`All` on every multi-select
  Search picker, excluding each card matching any selected value. Without it no
  filter can be inverted: a green non-creature or a creature without flying was
  unreachable, and the only negations available were hand-built trait pairs
  such as `Not Universes Beyond`, added one at a time because the general form
  did not exist. `None` MUST be the exact complement of `Any` over the same
  selection. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-038 — MUST:** Let the Format filter choose its legality state:
  Playable (legal or restricted), Banned, or Restricted. Playable alone cannot
  answer whether a card is banned in the format being built, which is the
  question a deck check asks. Unknown future statuses stay diagnosed under
  DATA-009 rather than being treated as any of these three. The chosen state
  MUST also scope the formats the picker offers, to those with at least one
  scoped card in that state: almost no format restricts anything, so listing
  all of them under Restricted offered a guaranteed-empty search. Format names
  MUST be displayed through one shared spelling used by Search, the deck pane
  and the card preview, because the stored keys are single lowercase words and
  capitalizing them renders real names as "Paupercommander".
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-036 — MUST:** Give every Search filter mode control the shared themed
  `ListChoice.TRadiobutton` indicator, so an Any/All or Within/Contains/Exactly
  choice reads the same as the deck format picker: hollow when unselected and
  gold when selected. The clam default draws a sunken square that matches
  nothing else in the application. Keep a filter whose bounds cannot coexist on
  one card in separate rows — Loyalty and Defense share no card, so combining
  them in one filter always returned nothing. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Naming and placement

- **NAM-001 — MUST:** Place a new module in the package that owns its layer and
  domain: presentation under `mtgdb/ui/`, shared domain-agnostic code under
  `mtgdb/core/`, and each other concern under its domain package.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **NAM-002 — MUST:** Let the folder convey layer/domain; do not re-encode it in
  the filename (`ui/tables.py`, not `ui/ui_tables.py`). _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **NAM-003 — MUST NOT:** Name a module with a Python reserved word or a stdlib
  top-level name that it would shadow within its package. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **NAM-004 — MUST:** Give each module a single exclusive responsibility and add
  it to both the Module ownership table and Module map in the same change. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **NAM-005 — MUST NOT:** Duplicate an existing component, token, style, parser,
  helper, taxonomy rule, storage rule, or worker pattern; extend the owning
  module instead. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **NAM-006 — MUST NOT:** Add a compatibility re-export shim module; import the
  owning module directly. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Required change method

- **CHG-001 — MUST:** Inspect the current implementation and the tests that
  exercise the behavior before editing it. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **CHG-002 — MUST:** Identify the owning module from the Feature map, Module ownership, and Module
  map before editing production code. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **CHG-003 — MUST:** Limit production edits to the owning module(s), their
  shared dependency layer, directly affected tests, and required build config.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **CHG-004 — MUST NOT:** Perform unrelated rewrites, broad renames, formatting
  sweeps, or cleanup during a focused task. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **CHG-005 — MUST:** Preserve unrelated behavior and add or update an automated
  regression whenever a durable requirement can be checked without human
  judgment. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **CHG-006 — MUST:** Preserve user-owned changes already in the working tree
  unless the user requests their removal. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **CHG-007 — MUST:** Update the Feature map, Module ownership table, Module map, and import matrix
  in the same change whenever a module gains, loses, or transfers a
  responsibility or an import boundary. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CHG-008 — MUST:** Complete every verification class governing the change
  before reporting it complete. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **CHG-009 — MUST:** When a refactor supersedes a private helper, callback,
  compatibility wrapper, widget-state cache, or duplicate implementation, remove
  the obsolete code and update tests/contracts to assert the current owner instead
  of preserving dead compatibility fossils. Public service/domain APIs and explicit
  diagnostic hooks require separate evidence before removal. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.

## Single-document policy

- **DOC-001 — MUST:** Keep `AGENTS.md` as the one and only project contract
  documentation file, and a single top-level `README.md` as the one and only
  user-facing document, in the source tree and every source-release archive.
  No other documentation file is permitted. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DOC-002 — MUST:** Limit this file to current rules, architecture, ownership,
  navigation, invariants, and verification. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **DOC-003 — MUST NOT:** Turn this file into a changelog, work log, audit,
  status report, roadmap, or before/after record. No deterministic check
  establishes this: the guardrail suite can confirm the prohibition is written
  down, which is not the same as confirming the document obeys it, so the
  reviewer states the result. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **DOC-004 — MUST NOT:** Create CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, NOTES, TODO, CONTRIBUTING,
  nested agent instructions, or any documentation file other than `AGENTS.md`
  and the single top-level `README.md`. The `README.md` is user-facing only
  (what the app is, how to get and run it, build-from-source, data/legal); it is
  not a changelog or work log. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DOC-005 — MUST NOT:** Add project documentation with `.md`, `.markdown`,
  `.rst`, `.adoc`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.odt`, or `.rtf`
  extensions. `AGENTS.md` and a single top-level `README.md` are the only
  exceptions. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DOC-006 — MAY:** Keep comments and docstrings inside source, and let the
  running app read/write user-selected deck `.txt` files and generated PDFs.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Search architecture

- **SRCH-001 — MUST:** Represent one semantic search with `SearchCriteria`
  before cache lookup or background execution. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-002 — MUST:** Route interactive DB access through `SearchRepository`
  and worker lifecycle through `SearchController`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-003 — MUST NOT:** Read a Tk widget or variable from a search worker
  thread. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **SRCH-004 — MUST:** Fetch broad results via the repository's narrow
  projection and upgrade a selected/acted row by exact Scryfall ID before
  full-card behavior. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-005 — MUST:** Create search checklist dialogs in `ui/search_checklist.py`
  and table-filter popups in `ui/table_filters.py` withdrawn, fully dark-styled
  while hidden, and map them only after complete first-frame controls exist. Reuse
  high-frequency popup shells instead of exposing reconstruction between opens.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-006 — MUST:** Keep large picker option sets behind a fixed reusable
  `VirtualChecklistView` pool of at most 32 live choice widgets and keep Search
  Results on a fixed reusable viewport of at most 128 live Tk `Treeview` items
  regardless of logical match count. Logical option/result count MUST NOT determine
  Tcl variable or widget count. Multi-select choices use compact top-aligned
  checkboxes; single-select Format choices use compact left-aligned themed radio
  controls (UI-010).
  A scrolling checklist MUST use its available viewport height so the final visible
  choice reaches almost to the bottom edge, without enlarging the choice widgets;
  its capacity/viewport calculation MUST use the actual DPI-scaled requested choice
  row height rather than assuming the nominal 24 px minimum;
  short picker catalogs MUST instead size their viewport/window down to the visible
  choices rather than vertically stretching a few choices to fill a large selector.
  Single-select picker viewports MUST retain 5 px of extra vertical clearance for
  the bottom radio label. The shared Printings Exact Set view MAY use two virtualized
  columns while retaining the same 32-widget cap. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-007 — MUST:** Display the complete known match count independently of
  row materialization progress. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-008 — MUST:** Apply Results sorting/filtering to the full matched set,
  not only materialized rows. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-009 — MUST:** Preserve Any/All, color, numeric, Content, language,
  Format, Rarity, trusted Card Type/Supertype/Subtype/Mechanic, Paper-only,
  optional Set Type, and independent Exact Set semantics. Shared Printing Tk state
  belongs to `PrintingFilter` in `ui/set_filters.py`; `ui/search_printings.py` MUST
  only adapt that component to Search. Search Format's empty value is the explicit
  **Any** radio choice: it MUST display selected whenever no specific format is
  active, and selecting it MUST replace/unselect every specific format. An empty Set
  Type or Exact Set selection means Any. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-034 — MUST:** Present Search with the common filters always on the form and every remaining existing capability behind one **Advanced Filter Options** button. The standard order is Card Name, then one visually explicit **TYPE LINE** block in printed order **Supertype → Card Type → Subtype**, then Mana Color and Power / Toughness. **Printings belongs in Advanced under Printing & Status.** The Advanced Filter Options button MUST span the width of the Search filter zone (LAY-011) and use a distinct section-control treatment rather than reading like another ordinary filter picker. Advanced remains built once and hidden/shown rather than rebuilt on expand. Its organizational groups are Search Scope, Mana, Card, and Printing & Status. Stable boolean predicates are divided into independent **Mana Cost Features**, **Special Properties**, and **Product / Status** facets; each facet owns its own Any/All/None mode and ANDs with the other facets. The legacy `traits`/`trait_mode` query path remains compatibility-only and MUST NOT be populated by the interactive Search UI. New workspace saves MUST persist each property's owning facet and mode; legacy workspace trait selections MUST be partitioned into their owning facets on restore, with an isolated legacy Single-faced selection translated to the equivalent Has multiple faces + None state. `Clear` MUST empty standard and Advanced values without removing controls, and workspace capture MUST preserve values plus Advanced open/closed state. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-035 — MUST:** Tooltips are a Search-filter teaching aid, not general application chrome. Attach application-owned tooltips only to Search filter labels, Search filter controls, and the mode/choice controls inside Search filter pickers; Search/Clear actions, the Advanced Filter Options section button, Results controls, deck controls, preview controls, Gallery controls, and other non-filter UI MUST NOT receive tooltips. Every Search filter tooltip MUST explain the user-visible filtering behavior and any important neighboring distinction in plain American English. Tooltip copy MUST NOT mention implementation or provenance such as Scryfall, a database, snapshots, APIs, trusted-vocabulary machinery, storage fields, or internal query names. Mana Color, Mana Produced, and Mana Symbols in Cost MUST be explained as distinct concepts. Mana Color tooltips MUST explain **Use: Color Identity vs Card Colors**, **Match: Within / Contains / Exactly**, and the special meaning of Colorless; Mana Produced MUST explain that `C` is actual colorless mana production; Mana Symbols in Cost MUST explain its Any/All/None Match mode, that Minimum is the total number of qualifying physical mana symbols, and that one hybrid/mixed symbol can represent multiple selected colors for Match while counting only once toward Minimum. Any/All/None tooltips MUST describe how adding choices broadens or narrows the filter where applicable. Live context SHOULD append useful predictive information to filter choices: discrete choices MAY show the number of cards compatible with that choice under the other current filters, numeric filters SHOULD show the applicable card count and current numeric range, and zero-result controls MUST explain why they are unavailable. Predictive wording MUST NOT claim an exact post-selection total for an Any/union choice when selected peers can broaden the final union. A selected value that has become incompatible MUST stay removable and its tooltip MUST explain that it can be deselected. User-facing taxonomy names MUST use real Magic concepts when such a concept exists; organizational UI headings MAY be plain-language group names but MUST NOT masquerade as Magic taxonomy. **Card Shape** and **Card Traits** MUST NOT appear as user-facing filter categories: layout is presented as **Card Form**, and stable boolean predicates are presented through Search Scope, Mana Cost Features, **Special Properties**, and Product / Status. Special Properties consolidates Power greater than toughness, Variable power or toughness, Has a color indicator, and Has multiple faces. Tooltips MUST reach the operated controls, not only labels. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-033 — MUST:** Filter produced mana from the stored `produced_mana`
  column, never from colour identity or rules text. Colour identity answers a
  different question — Birds of Paradise has identity `G` and produces every
  colour, Command Tower has no identity at all — and 653 producers carry no
  mana symbol in their text because they read "add one mana of any color".
  `produced_mana` and `color_identity` share one comma-joined WUBRG(+C)
  encoding stored in alphabetical order, so both filters MUST share one
  builder helper and an exact match MUST sort the requested set; building the
  needle in `COLORS` order makes every multi-colour `Exactly` search return
  nothing. Colourless is an empty colour identity but an explicit `C` member of
  produced mana, so the Produces filter offers `C` as a real choice while the
  Mana Color filter MUST release it as soon as a colour is selected — a card
  cannot be colourless and a colour, and silently dropping the `C` from the
  query made White plus Colorless return exactly the mono-white result.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-039 — MUST:** Let the Mana Color filter choose which colour column it
  reads: colour identity, or the colours the card itself is. The two disagree
  often enough to be separate questions — a colourless card can have a
  coloured identity, and W+U exactly returns 1,582 printings by identity
  against 1,062 by card colours. The mode row below the pips MUST name the
  column currently selected, so `Color identity:` never sits above a search of
  the other one. A criterion the query layer supports MUST NOT sit without a
  control: colour scope and Artist both kept working SQL, a criterion and a
  passing gate after their controls were gone, which is a feature no user can
  run, proved by a test. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-040 — MUST:** Derive face structure from Scryfall `card_faces`, never from a maintained layout list. Interactive Search exposes only **Has multiple faces** inside Special Properties; selecting that property with Match None is the user-facing route to single-faced cards, while legacy `single_faced` query compatibility remains intact. Preserve the existing Scryfall `layout` query capability under the user-facing **Card Form** label. Card Form vocabulary MUST be observed Scryfall layout values; a card has one layout, so the existing Any/None modes remain. A layout MAY be suppressed from Card Form only when background taxonomy analysis proves its complete scoped printing population is exactly equal to a same-named existing Card Type, Supertype, Subtype, or Mechanic population. This equivalence MUST be data-derived rather than a handwritten list, and a legacy saved selected layout MUST remain visible until cleared so restore never changes query meaning. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-041 — MUST:** Store per-row what a search would otherwise aggregate.
  Coloured pip counts are computed at import, not per query: counted in SQL
  they can use no index and cannot see hybrid halves. A hybrid symbol counts
  once for each of its colours, which is how devotion reads it and what "costs
  two green" means. A stored count that cannot follow the current filters MUST
  say so in its tooltip rather than appear to. The reverse holds when a filter
  is withdrawn: a stored column with no criterion is the same orphan SRCH-039
  forbids one layer down, and it costs every import and every row. Printed in
  was built on a stored `print_sets` column, was not wanted, and left neither
  behind. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-042 — MUST:** Keep the Results row pool in step with the store on
  every scroll: each pooled row shows the store's row for its ring position,
  or shows nothing, and the Treeview's physical order matches the ring. Two
  faults broke this and both surfaced as rows that sat still while the rest of
  the list scrolled past them. A slot with no row to show — the pool is larger
  than the viewport, so the last ones are past the end of any result set — was
  left holding its previous card and was not moved, and rows leaving the top
  were each moved to their final index while the ones ahead of them had not
  moved yet, which interleaved the pool below the fold until enough scrolling
  brought the damage back into view. Rows rotating to the bottom MUST be moved
  to the end rather than to a computed index, because each move is a remove
  and an insert. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-043 — MUST:** Clamp each end of a Results selection range into the
  visible list on its own before ordering the pair. Clamping the smaller end
  against zero and the larger against the last row leaves a range that begins
  past the end inverted — 20..30 of ten rows became 9..20 — which the identity
  path filled from the top of the list and wrote off the end of the bitset,
  raising IndexError inside a Tk callback. A range that starts past the end
  MUST select the last row, not the whole list, and MUST NOT leave the
  selection count larger than the store.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-045 — MUST:** Treat Search context as a live draft facet system rather than post-result decoration. Every valid committed filter change MUST debounce into one latest-wins Tk-free `SearchCriteria` context request before the user presses Search; foreground Results remain manual. Manual Search and live context MUST capture criteria through the same adapter. Every existing Search dimension MUST participate through contextual compatibility counts, observed numeric/release ranges, or the live total; context MUST respect the dimension's actual Any/All/None, Within/Contains/Exactly, legality, mana-symbol total threshold, platform, content-scope, and independent property-facet semantics. Mana Symbols in Cost MUST use its own Any/All/None mode: All requires every selected symbol color to be represented, Any requires at least one, and None excludes every selected color. For All/Any, Minimum is a total count of qualifying physical brace-delimited mana symbols, not a per-color threshold; a hybrid/mixed symbol can satisfy multiple selected-color presence requirements but MUST count only once toward that total. Mana Cost Features, Special Properties, and Product / Status MUST each relax and predict only their own property facet so one group's selection or Match mode cannot inflate, suppress, or otherwise alter another group's candidate counts except through normal cross-filter intersection. For an `Any` multi-select facet, each value's displayed compatibility count MUST be measured against all other Search dimensions while excluding the facet's other selected values, so an already-selected OR value cannot make an otherwise incompatible peer appear usable. Union-style existing dimensions such as Search Scope, Printing Type, and `Within` color/mana sets MUST likewise count a candidate's own compatible contribution rather than letting already-selected peers keep every option above zero. `All`/`None` facets and narrowing set modes such as `Contains` MAY retain prospective add-value counts because those modes narrow the current facet. An unselected authoritative value with a zero compatibility count MUST remain visible, MUST carry an explicit red `✕` unavailable marker, and MUST NOT be selectable by direct or bulk actions. A selected value that later becomes zero MUST remain visible and removable so context never traps the user in a conflict. Empty Mana Value, Power, Toughness, Loyalty, Defense, and Released range controls MUST gray/disable when their relaxed facet has no applicable values, but a range containing a user value MUST remain editable so the conflict can be cleared. The UI MUST consume those live applicability signals for every range; it MUST NOT infer applicability from Card Type, layout, or a maintained incompatibility table. For Mana Value specifically, numeric zero alone MUST NOT establish applicability: a row MUST count as Mana Value-applicable only when it has a meaningful mana cost on the card or one of its faces; a literal `{0}` cost is meaningful, while a no-cost object whose rules-derived mana value defaults to 0 MUST NOT by itself keep Mana Value enabled. Unselected zero-result Mana Color, Mana Produced, and Mana Symbols in Cost choices MUST likewise gray/disable, while selected zero-result choices remain clearable. Mana Color Colorless means the selected card-color/identity set is empty, while Mana Produced `C` means explicit colorless mana production; contextual availability MUST preserve that distinction rather than sharing one `C` rule between the two facets. Context MUST NOT add a filter dimension, silently change a selection, or remove an authoritative value. Stale analysis MUST be canceled or ignored, broad totals MUST use canonical `COUNT(*)` rather than materializing ordered result IDs, context row projections MUST be narrow/unordered, and repeated snapshots MUST use a bounded cache invalidated with the database. Zero-result relaxation suggestions MAY only remove or change modes of existing filters. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-046 — MUST:** The Card Preview `Gallery` action MUST open a modeless, user-resizable and maximizable, continuously scrollable dense image gallery over the complete current visible Results view and order, including accepted Results table filtering/sorting. Its header MUST present `RESULTS GALLERY | <count> CARDS`, and it MUST provide a live card-size slider that changes the actual target card-art width while recomputing columns and visible coverage. The initial target width MUST be 280 pixels, and the Gallery MUST NOT display a separate persistent numeric `px` readout beside the slider. Larger windows or smaller card sizes MUST materially show more cards rather than stretching gutters. Vertical Gallery movement MUST be pixel-continuous rather than row-snapped or page-snapped: mouse-wheel and scrollbar movement MUST permit partially clipped cards at the top and bottom edges, the viewport MUST remain filled to its bottom edge whenever additional logical results exist, and no blank band MAY be reserved merely to fit only complete card rows. Image cells MUST remain tightly spaced with no persistent caption row beneath each card. A primary click on a Gallery card MUST open an enlarged temporary card image that dismisses when focus leaves it; that enlarged view MUST offer rotation, and face-flip whenever the card has more than one separately imaged face, re-requesting the art for the shown face and rotation. A Gallery card context click MUST expose the same dark `Add to Mainboard` / `Add to Sideboard` actions as Results and route those actions through the existing Results/deck command path rather than duplicating deck mutation logic. The gallery MUST virtualize to a bounded reusable set of live card slots independent of logical result count, including only enough buffered rows to cover partial viewport edges; it MUST hydrate exact printings only for visible/buffered slots through `ui/results.py`, request images and enlarged previews through `CardImageService`, and never construct one Tk card cell or one image request per logical result. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-044 — MUST:** Give every table column one display value, produced by
  `search/results.table_value`, and filter on that same value. Every column
  heading opens a filter, so a column with no value has a filter that cannot
  work: Cost fell through to `""` while the filter layer held a second
  spelling of its own, so its popup listed the printed costs while matching
  compared them against nothing — the Cost filter emptied Results and both
  deck boards, and its inverse kept every row. A filter layer MUST NOT carry a
  display rule the matcher does not share. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-010 — MUST NOT:** Define `_do_search`, `_render_results`,
  `_show_table_filter`, or `_open_search_multi_picker` on `DeckBuilderApp`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-011 — MUST:** Route the deck action that searches alternate printings
  through the Search feature's `_apply_cards_search_preset`; direct manipulation
  of individual search widgets or filter variables is prohibited in `ui/deck.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-012 — MUST:** Capture and restore Search-owned workspace state in
  `ui/search.py`; `ui/workspace.py` coordinates persistence without knowledge of
  individual Search widget/catalog/set-variable names. The saved scope MUST
  include the Paper/Arena/MTGO selection itself and not only the paper flag
  derived from it, or an Arena session reopens on paper. State owned by an
  optional row MUST be restored after the rows are rebuilt: the row's widgets
  are created by that rebuild, so anything applied before it is discarded
  along with the variables that held it. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-013 — MUST:** Keep the complete logical Results set in
  `search/results.py` and only its fixed-slot viewport adaptation in `ui/results.py`;
  preserve selection by exact Scryfall printing ID outside Tk, never by physical
  slot or row index, and restore workspace selection only after the matching logical
  view is available. The Results Gallery MUST consume that same complete current visible view/order rather than creating a second Search result store. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-014 — MUST:** Make `SearchController.invalidate()` invalidate every
  queued or in-flight prior generation, allow a current-database search to start,
  and reject stale worker events without restoring their cache.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-015 — MUST:** Validate editable numeric Search fields before creating
  `SearchCriteria`, reject non-numeric or non-finite values and
  minimum-greater-than-maximum ranges with a clear UI error, reject non-finite
  numeric values again at the query-builder boundary, and never raise those
  validation errors through a Tk callback. Every pair of bounds is validated,
  including the optional ones: Loyalty, Defense and Released went unchecked
  for a while, so a backwards range ran and returned nothing, which a user
  cannot tell apart from a search that genuinely matches no card. Every numeric
  box's error MUST name that box ("Power minimum", say), not a generic
  "filter value".
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-016 — MUST:** Treat Scryfall legality statuses `legal` and `restricted`
  as playable for format Search, retain the restricted distinction in card-detail
  presentation, and reject unknown content-filter vocabulary instead of silently
  broadening a query. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-017 — MUST:** When a new Search criterion or Results field needs card
  data not already stored, inspect and update `database/schema.py` and
  `database/bulk_import.py` before Search-layer code; Search modules MUST NOT
  emulate a missing stored field or parse raw Scryfall bulk payloads.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-018 — MUST:** Keep the Results Treeview in native `extended` selection
  mode: Ctrl-click changes highlight membership and MUST NOT mutate comparison.
  Treat the focused highlighted row as the preview/status primary while toolbar
  and context batch actions operate on every highlighted Results card. `Add Mainboard`
  / `Add Sideboard` add the complete highlighted batch to the corresponding board;
  Results highlighting MUST remain available to the global comparison bar so one
  `Add Selected` action can combine Results with highlighted Mainboard/Sideboard
  cards subject to the seven-card limit. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-019 — MUST:** `Clear` resets every Search criterion and its visible control
  summary to the trusted defaults: Cards-only content with Tokens, Emblems, and Art
  Series off; Paper-only; Any Set Type/Set;
  no Subtype/Mechanic/Rarity/Card Type/Supertype/Color/Produces/Format/numeric
  restriction, no optional filter rows,
  empty Rules Text and name/exact-name batch, and English-only enabled. It MUST also
  deselect current Results/Mainboard/Sideboard highlights without removing cards
  already stored in the comparison collection. Subtype, Mechanics, Format, and
  Rarity MUST display `Any` when unrestricted. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-020 — MUST:** A deck context search for multiple highlighted rows uses one
  exact-name batch criteria snapshot containing every distinct selected card name;
  a single selected row uses the same preset path with one exact name. The Card Name field
  MAY display the batch summary, but SQL ownership remains in
  `database/search_queries.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-021 — MUST:** Keep the standard Search surface compact and stable: Card Name; the Type Line block Supertype, Card Type, Subtype; Mana Color; and Power / Toughness. Keep all other existing filters, including Printings, in Advanced under SRCH-034. Search Scope contains exactly the existing Cards, Tokens, Emblems, and Art Series choices. There is no `More Types`, `Characteristics`, `Card Shape`, or `Card Traits` user-facing filter; named Scryfall keyword/ability data is presented as `Mechanics`, and observed Scryfall layouts are presented as `Card Form`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-022 — MUST:** Rebuild trusted filter vocabulary when Content or Paper-only
  scope changes and prune selected values that no longer exist in that scope.
  Workspace restore MAY select values already in the current vocabulary but MUST
  NOT add card types, Supertypes, Subtypes, Mechanics, Formats, Rarities, Set Types,
  or Sets to that vocabulary. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **SRCH-023 — MUST:** Do not render a duplicate aggregate `Active Filters`
  summary above the Search actions. Mechanics and Subtype picker buttons MUST list
  selected values directly through the first ten selections and then append `+N`
  for the remainder; Rarity MUST list every selected rarity. Mechanics, Format,
  Subtype, and Rarity MUST use `Any` as their unrestricted
  button text. The Subtype picker summary MUST remain one horizontal line and
  MUST NOT insert line breaks; other picker summaries MAY wrap to preserve
  readable widths without changing the underlying selection state. Shared multi-select filter
  dialogs MUST label their visible bulk-select action `Select All` and their visible
  bulk-clear action `Clear Selected`; the Exact Set bulk-select action MUST also read
  `Select All`. These label changes do not broaden the established visible/filtered
  action scope. Search Printings MUST display no introductory instruction directly
  below its title; Exact Set guidance/status below the Exact Set section remains
  unchanged. Deck TXT import MUST NOT open a Printings picker.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **SRCH-032 — SHOULD:** Word the Mechanics and Subtype picker helper text as
  `Choose one or several card mechanics.` and `Choose one or several card
  subtypes.` respectively. This is user-facing copy rather than structure, so a
  clearer wording is a decision for the user to approve rather than a release
  blocker under GOV-002. The picker's placement, summary behavior, and
  unrestricted `Any` text stay mandatory under SRCH-023.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.

- **SRCH-024 — MUST:** Search Rules Text against the normalized complete Oracle
  text of every card face. Within one unquoted Rules Text chip, every normalized
  word MUST occur but MAY have other words between it; a chip wrapped in double
  quotes MUST require that normalized phrase contiguously. Rules Text `All`/`Any`
  MUST combine complete chips, SQL wildcard characters MUST remain literal, and
  query construction MUST stay in `database/search_queries.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **SRCH-025 — MUST:** `SearchResultStore` owns every logical broad-result row and
  the current complete ordered index. Treeview slots are disposable presentation;
  there is no result cap or artificial paging, and Preview, Compare, Add Mainboard,
  Add Sideboard, and the Results Gallery hydrate exact printings only when needed. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-026 — MUST:** Prepare Results filtering/sorting and categorical column
  vocabularies off the Tk thread with latest-generation protection. The old logical
  view remains usable until an accepted replacement swaps atomically; stale worker
  output MUST NOT overwrite newer filter/sort state. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-027 — MUST:** Discover trusted Card Type/Supertype/Subtype/Mechanic/Format/
  Rarity/Set Type/Exact Set taxonomy asynchronously after first paint and on cold
  Content/Paper/Set-Type scopes. Database replacement MUST invalidate bounded
  taxonomy caches and use the same worker path. Card Type and Supertype MAY use the
  last successfully published trusted labels as presentation-only warm-start chips,
  but those chips MUST remain disabled until the current asynchronous scope is
  accepted; a true first-run cold start MAY use unlabeled disabled chip shells and
  MUST NOT invent taxonomy labels. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-028 — MUST:** Bound Search taxonomy snapshot caches and result vocabulary
  caches with LRU eviction. Cache scope MUST include every authority-changing
  Content/Paper/Set-Type input so stale vocabulary cannot cross scopes.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-029 — MUST:** Use an inverse logical-view index for O(1) exact-printing
  position lookup, cooperatively abort obsolete long Results preparations, and use
  row-ring rotation for small logical scroll deltas so a one-row wheel step does
  not rewrite the full physical viewport. Logical multi-selection MUST remain
  bitset/range compact for very large selections while normal sparse selection
  count/order operations scale with selected rows rather than scanning the complete
  100k logical view. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-030 — MUST:** Preserve the last complete trusted Search controls while a
  cold taxonomy scope is prepared; loading MUST disable/rebind stable controls
  rather than collapse the visible layout into temporary widget trees. Supertype
  and Card Type MUST NOT replace their chip rows with transient loading/empty-state
  prose: keep trusted warm-start chips visible but grayed out, or unlabeled disabled
  chip shells when no trusted warm-start exists yet. Card Type/Supertype chip rows
  MUST NEVER contain loading, empty-state, or authority-failure prose; accepted
  authority failures MUST be reported outside those rows (for example the status
  surface/log) while the affected chips remain disabled. A failed async taxonomy
  request MUST re-enable the last stable controls, restore stable Printings summary
  text, and discard pending restore state that could later overwrite new user edits.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-031 — MUST:** A user Search requested while trusted taxonomy is loading
  MUST be retained as one pending intent and automatically execute exactly once after
  the newest accepted catalog snapshot finishes. If an older query is still running,
  that one intent MUST remain queued until the query also reaches a terminal event.
  Repeated clicks MUST NOT queue duplicate searches, Search Clear MUST cancel that
  pending intent, and taxonomy failure MUST leave the Results header in a stable
  non-loading state and lower the `Loading filters…` activity cue (SRCH-047)
  rather than leave either stranded. Queuing the intent MUST NOT rewrite the
  Results header: the activity cue already names the wait. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-047 — MUST:** Announce every wait the user can feel through one large
  centered activity cue, not through small inline text. The cue is the
  `ui/components.py` `ActivityIndicator`: a single label packed last, expanding, in
  the Search action row between the Search/Clear group and the Add
  Mainboard/Add Sideboard group (LAY-003), empty and so zero-footprint when idle.
  It MUST use the shared `FONT_ACTIVITY` role in the gold `working`/`working_dim`
  pulse (never the error red), MUST request a constant one-character width so
  showing text never resizes the row or pane, MUST be no taller than the buttons
  beside it at every supported display scale, and MUST yield to those buttons on a
  narrow pane. The app-wide `*Font` option gives every ttk label `FONT_BODY` at
  widget level, which beats a style's font, so the cue's size is set on the label
  itself. By priority it MUST show `Searching…` (a running Search), then
  `Loading filters…` (a trusted-catalog request in flight: raised when it starts,
  lowered when its snapshot is applied or it fails, and so covering the startup
  window in which the filters are disabled), then `Updating…` (a live context
  recompute); equal priorities show the most recently started. Every source MUST
  go through the shared threshold (`STATUS_THRESHOLD_MS`, so instant work never
  flashes) and `ACTIVITY_MIN_DWELL_MS` minimum dwell, and `cancel()` MUST clear the
  cue at once. Trusted-filter loading MUST NOT suppress the cue. The
  `Current filters match N cards…` line stays under the Results header and carries
  only its idle text, painted the moment a snapshot lands rather than waiting
  behind the cue; the Results header keeps its count while a Search runs.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-048 — MUST:** Read the Mana Symbols in Cost Minimum through the one
  shared `database/semantics.pip_minimum_threshold`, in the SQL builder, the SQLite
  context worker, and the bitset index alike. The Minimum box always holds a value
  and its untouched default of `1` is plain colour presence, so the bitset index
  MUST represent it; only a Minimum that resolves above one MAY decline to the
  SQLite worker. Treating any non-empty Minimum as explicit sent every request the
  real UI ever made down the slow SQLite path (1.5–4 s per filter click) while the
  index was built and never used. The differential battery MUST carry the default
  Minimum, and a spy on the SQLite count MUST show the UI's default criteria being
  served by the index. The shared reader MUST NOT raise: a non-finite Minimum reads
  as one there, is rejected by the SQL builder at its boundary like every other
  numeric filter (SRCH-015), and is declined by the index so the builder answers it.
  Under Any, each candidate colour's count is measured ALONE (SRCH-045), so an
  already-selected colour's symbols cannot lift it to a Minimum above one: the
  count once showed 9 for Red where selecting Red returned 5. The index MUST decline a non-finite value in ANY numeric criterion (Mana Value,
  Power, Toughness, Loyalty, Defense, release year, and the Minimum) rather than
  answer or raise for it: an infinite release year made it raise `OverflowError`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-049 — MUST:** Start background work in the order the user is waiting on it.
  `_start_post_paint_initialization` MUST start only the trusted-catalog request,
  workspace restore, and the update check. The facet-index warm-up starts when the
  first trusted-catalog snapshot is applied, and the other-scope catalog warm-ups
  when the first live context snapshot is applied (`_advance_search_warmups`, each
  stage once); after a database sync the index is rebuilt by `database_sync`. These
  stages are CPU-bound Python sharing one interpreter lock, so launching them beside
  the catalog load stretched that load from about two seconds to five and kept the
  filters disabled for all of it. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-050 — MUST:** Keep the count on a property option equal to what selecting
  it returns, by reading the same predicate the filter stores. `_trait_keys` (the
  count) and `derive_trait_flags` (the filter) MUST agree on every property key.
  Hybrid mana is any brace symbol with two or more non-Phyrexian choices
  (`mana_cost_has_hybrid_symbol`): a split or adventure cost's `//` is not a hybrid
  symbol, and a compleated `{G/W/P}` is one. The Results Cost column's Hybrid and
  Phyrexian groups MUST classify a single-face cost the same way. The count once
  read a looser rule and showed 2,287 for an option whose selection returned 1,493.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-051 — MUST:** Never publish a facet index built from rows that a database
  refresh has since replaced. A refresh's reset MUST invalidate an in-flight build
  (an epoch checked before publishing), and the discarded build MUST be followed by
  a rebuild, so the index never keeps serving pre-refresh counts until restart.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-052 — MUST:** Find a two-faced card (transform, modal, flip) by EITHER
  face's cost and stats. The back face's cost, Power, Toughness, Loyalty and
  Defense are stored beside the front's (`back_mana_cost`, `back_power`,
  `back_toughness`, `back_loyalty`, `back_defense`, schema version 18); the colour
  columns (`pips_*`) and `trait_flags` are computed over both faces, and every
  engine reads them the same way: the SQL builder (a stat range is met when either
  face meets it; a symbol match reads every face's cost), the bitset index (a back
  value lands in the same bitsets as the front's), and the SQLite context worker.
  Each condition is judged independently, but a face's own Power is compared with
  its own Toughness, so top-heavy never pairs one face's Power with the other's
  Toughness. Symbol totals count every face once, as split cards already did;
  `back_mana_cost` is empty when the top-level cost already holds both halves
  ("A // B"), so no symbol is counted twice. Mana Value is the card's own and has
  no back-face counterpart. The row, the Results and deck table columns, and the
  Results column filters keep showing and filtering the FRONT face. A card's own
  colours (Mana Color with the Colors scope) are the colours of EVERY face
  together, as its colour identity already is: the back face's colours are stored
  as `back_colors` / `back_colors_mask` (NULL means no back face, an empty string a
  colourless one) and read as the front's OR the back's, in the SQL builder, the
  bitset index and the context worker alike. Reading each face separately would
  let a spell // land card's colourless back match every "within" and Colorless
  search. The differential battery MUST include two-faced cards, and named
  expectations MUST pin which cards are found. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-053 — MUST:** Match Card Name without regard to case OR accents:
  "eowyn", "éowyn" and "ÉOWYN" all find Éowyn, and "aether" finds Æther Vial.
  The folded copy is stored (`name_search`, made by `semantics.fold_search_text`:
  decompose, drop combining marks, casefold, ligatures to letters) and both the
  typed text and the stored name pass through that one function, so the SQL
  builder, the bitset index and autocomplete agree. SQLite's own `LIKE` folds only
  A-Z, which is why accents needed this. An exact-name batch stays exact.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-054 — MUST:** Keep a quoted Rules Text phrase inside one face. The rules
  text of a card's faces is joined with `FACE_TEXT_BOUNDARY` (not whitespace, so
  normalization keeps it, and never typed), so a phrase cannot match across the
  seam between the two halves of a split card or two faces of any card; separate
  words still combine across the whole card. Whole-word matching within a face is
  deliberately unchanged. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SRCH-055 — MUST:** Read a card's colours, colour identity, and producible mana
  as EMPTY when none of their comma-joined members is a recognized W/U/B/R/G/C
  token, on every engine alike — matching `color_mask()`, the stored
  `colors_mask`/`identity_mask`/`produced_mask` columns it fills, and the SQL
  builder's own `produced_mask != 0` guard against Mana Produced "Within"/
  "Includes" otherwise matching every card that produces nothing. A real printed
  card's Scryfall `produced_mana` named a token outside those six letters (a
  joke ability, not real mana); the stored mask correctly read it as producing
  nothing, but the facet index's own emptiness check (`mark_colors` in
  `search/facet_index.py`) read "the raw string is non-empty" instead of "no
  recognized colour is present" and let the card slip through live Mana
  Produced counts and results SQL did not. The SQLite context worker's own
  predictive counts (`_predict_colors`/`_color_match` in `search/context.py`)
  carried the identical flaw in their own emptiness check, unreachable through
  today's data only because no real card's `colors`/`color_identity` yet
  carries such a token; both read the same filtered, recognized-only member set.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Database internals architecture


- **DBI-001 — MUST:** Keep `CardDB` in `database/db.py` as the stable façade
  composed from `CardQueryMixin`, `CardSearchQueryMixin`, and `CardTaxonomyMixin`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-002 — MUST:** Keep schema version, tables, indexes, connection policy,
  query-function registration, migration, and init in `database/schema.py`, and
  make every schema migration one rollback-safe transaction. Opening the primary
  connection MUST first quarantine a malformed `cards.db` (moving it and its WAL
  sidecars aside as `*.corrupt`) and let a fresh empty database be created, so a
  truncated or corrupt file recovers on the next launch instead of crashing
  startup; the probe MUST close its connection before quarantining so no handle
  keeps the file locked on Windows. Only an error that says the FILE is damaged
  (`SQLITE_CORRUPT`, `SQLITE_NOTADB`) is corruption: a locked database, a disk I/O
  error or an unopenable file (antivirus, a backup tool, OneDrive) MUST be retried
  briefly and then left in place, never quarantined, since quarantining a healthy
  database discards a 500 MB download. Damage below the first page passes the
  startup probe and surfaces only when something reads the bad page, so a sync
  that meets it MUST raise `DatabaseDamagedError` after writing a rebuild request
  beside the database; the next launch, with nothing holding the file open, MUST
  quarantine it and rebuild from Scryfall. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-003 — MUST:** Keep row projection, strict streaming bulk parsing,
  isolated replacement transactions, distinct committed-card threshold
  protection, and index rebuild in `database/bulk_import.py`; malformed JSONL,
  trailing JSON garbage, unterminated arrays, non-card records, and missing card
  identity MUST abort replacement. The streaming array parser MUST keep reading
  while a decode is starved of input, never only while its buffer is small: a
  single card object larger than the read size otherwise never completes, and
  the import spins forever with no error and no progress. Scryfall's Treasure
  token already exceeds 95,000 characters because its `all_parts` names every
  card that makes a Treasure, and it grows with every set. Every parse failure
  MUST surface as an exception rather than as a hang. Universes Beyond
  classification MUST come from Scryfall's own `universesbeyond` promo type as
  well as the legacy triangle security stamp, applied set-wide: the stamp alone
  stopped identifying crossover sets once The Hobbit, Avatar, Marvel and
  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shipped with the ordinary oval stamp, which both
  leaked them into Search when excluding Universes Beyond and let them win deck
  import, several being typed `expansion` and so competing with main Magic
  releases on release date. A change to that rule MUST be repairable in place
  from stored rows, never by requiring the user to download the card snapshot
  again. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-004 — MUST:** Keep rules normalization, type-line repair, and type/subtype
  matching functions in `database/semantics.py` without SQLite connections or UI
  dependencies. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-005 — MUST:** Keep exact-printing retrieval, resolver ranking, and name
  suggestions in `database/queries.py`; keep canonical search construction,
  parameter ordering, projection validation, `SearchQueryBuilder`, and the stable
  `CardDB.search()` mixin implementation in `database/search_queries.py`.
  A printing whose collector number carries another set's prefix is a booster
  insert, not a release of its own, and MUST NOT rank as a main Magic release:
  The List is typed `masters` and updated continuously, so without this it wins
  import for every card it has ever carried. The demotion MUST apply only where
  a printing would otherwise rank as a main release, leaving Secret Lair and
  promo printings at the tier they already hold, and MUST stay metadata-driven
  rather than becoming a maintained set-code list.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-006 — MUST:** Keep set/format/rarity/type/subtype/keyword/catalog
  classification queries in `mtgdb/database/taxonomy.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-007 — MUST NOT:** Import `database/db.py` from any database-internals
  module or create a cycle through the façade. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-008 — MUST NOT:** Put schema, connection construction, bulk extraction,
  canonical search construction, or taxonomy discovery directly in the façade.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-009 — MUST:** Preserve schema version 19, the card-column contract,
  search indexes, WAL, query-only readers, and registered type/subtype
  functions. Every connection opened in `database/schema.py` MUST set an
  explicit `busy_timeout` rather than inherit the 5-second `sqlite3` default;
  the primary connection is used from background threads and is never the
  first to give up while a bulk rebuild holds the database.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-011 — MUST:** Upgrade the card table in place when a schema change adds
  columns that stored data can supply, instead of dropping it. A rebuild empties
  `cards` and re-downloads about 500 MB, and left the first launch after an update
  looking like an empty database. Each upgrade step (`schema._UPGRADES`, from
  `_OLDEST_UPGRADABLE_VERSION`) runs in ONE transaction and computes its columns
  with the same functions the importer uses (`face_dependent_columns`,
  `fold_search_text`, `_all_oracle_text`), so an upgraded database holds exactly
  what a fresh import would; a test MUST compare them row for row from every
  supported older shape. A step that fails MUST roll back and fall through to the
  rebuild, and a schema older than the oldest upgradable one MUST still rebuild.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBI-010 — MUST:** Preserve exact-printing identity, search semantics, import
  resolution, catalog fallback, and public `CardDB` method signatures.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Database synchronization architecture

- **DBS-001 — MUST:** Route automatic and manual refreshes through
  `DatabaseSyncService` and `DatabaseSyncController` in `database/sync.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-002 — MUST:** Keep Scryfall bulk/catalog retrieval, official Wizards
  Rules-page TXT discovery/strict Supertype parsing/provenance persistence, the
  48-hour due policy, phase timing, progress events, cancellation, and temp
  cleanup in `database/sync.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-003 — MUST NOT:** Import or call `core/net.py` from `database/db.py` or
  from database-refresh UI modules. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-004 — MUST:** Keep `database/sync.py` Tk-free and `ui/database_sync.py`
  free of network transport and worker creation. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-005 — MUST:** Permit at most one sync worker, tag events by generation,
  and coalesce display progress before Tk presentation. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-006 — MUST:** Retain the old committed dataset until a replacement of at
  least 1,000 distinct rows actually present in SQLite commits with rebuilt
  indexes. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-007 — MUST:** Refresh catalogs but skip bulk download/import when the
  local DB matches the current upstream bulk revision. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-008 — MUST:** Remove the bulk temp file after success/failure/cancel and
  preserve the committed DB after an incomplete import. Because a terminated or
  crashed process never runs that cleanup, the sync service MUST also remove
  abandoned `scryfall_*.download` files beside the database when it is
  constructed. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-009 — MUST:** Keep refresh scheduling, progress dialog, Tk polling,
  completion reconciliation, error presentation, and shutdown adaptation in
  `ui/database_sync.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-010 — MUST NOT:** Define sync methods on `DeckBuilderApp` or call
  `CardDB.sync` from production code. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-011 — MUST:** Cooperatively cancel an incomplete refresh during shutdown
  and stop Tk polling before destroying the root. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-012 — MUST:** Verify HTTP `Content-Length` when supplied, reject premature
  EOF, remove partial downloads on every failed final attempt, and use bounded
  transient retries for both bulk files and raw image bytes. Cleanup MUST remove
  only a file the failing attempt itself opened: a request that fails before any
  transfer begins MUST leave whatever was already at the destination alone.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-015 — MUST:** Retrieve only `https` URLs in `core/net.py`, and reject any
  other scheme before opening it. `urlopen` is installed with `file`, `ftp` and
  `data` handlers, so an unchecked URL is not merely a failed download: on
  Windows a `file://host/share` URL is an SMB connection that offers the
  machine's credentials to whoever answers, and Python's redirect handler
  permits `ftp` even when the original URL was `https`. Every URL this
  application retrieves originates in a Scryfall response or the card database
  and is already `https`. The URL guards in this module MUST also stay total,
  returning or raising a clear result for a non-string rather than escaping as
  `AttributeError`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-013 — MUST:** Treat any missing trusted Scryfall catalog or missing
  verified Wizards Supertype taxonomy as refresh-due metadata. Refresh both
  taxonomy sources on upgrade/startup and, when the bulk revision is already
  current, satisfy that repair without downloading/reimporting the card snapshot.
  A failed/unrecognized Wizards Rules refresh MUST preserve the last verified
  Supertype taxonomy; when no verified value exists, Supertypes MUST fail closed
  to no selectable vocabulary. A failed Scryfall `card-types` refresh MUST likewise
  preserve any last successful catalog. Persist the last Wizards Supertype and
  Scryfall Card Type taxonomy-refresh failures separately from verified values so
  UI code can distinguish missing authority from a valid current Content/Paper
  scope with no matching values and can surface a clear retry instruction.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-014 — MUST:** Request Wizards Rules-page/TXT resources with document-
  appropriate HTTP media types and a browser-compatible Wizards-only User-Agent
  (while preserving the identifying application User-Agent for Scryfall), and
  discover the current Comprehensive Rules TXT only from explicit HTTPS
  `media.wizards.com` `MagicCompRules` TXT URLs present in the official Rules-page
  response. Media downloads MUST carry the official Rules page as their referrer.
  Discovery MUST support both ordinary anchor markup and URLs embedded in serialized
  page data. Explicit official asset paths containing ordinary spaces MUST be
  canonicalized to percent-encoded request URLs before transport; candidates
  containing actual C0/DEL control characters MUST be rejected. Discovery MUST
  reject ambiguous or non-Wizards candidates rather than guessing a filename.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-016 — MUST:** Record what a refresh downloaded (`last_sync_updated_at`, the
  refresh time, the classification rule) in the SAME transaction as the cards, and
  let nothing after that commit abort the run. A shutdown, cancel or housekeeping
  error once the replacement is durable MUST NOT report the update as cancelled or
  failed: doing so skipped the record and forced a full re-download on the next
  launch. A failure after the cards were replaced MUST still refresh the search
  caches built from the old cards. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-017 — MUST:** Distinguish "could not ask Scryfall whether the card data is
  current" from "there is something new". With a usable local library, a failed
  bulk-metadata check (a rate limit or an outage) MUST raise
  `DatabaseSyncUnavailable` and download nothing; the trusted catalogs are still
  attempted. Only with no library at all is the download made without that answer.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-018 — MUST:** Retry a trusted catalog source that keeps failing on a
  schedule, not on every launch. Every catalog refresh records
  `catalogs:last_attempt_epoch`; missing catalogs or Supertypes make a refresh
  due only when that attempt is at least `CATALOG_RETRY_SECONDS` (24 hours) old
  (a stamp from the future counts as old). A manual update and the 48-hour
  refresh are unaffected. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-019 — MUST:** Word the refresh dialog for the reason it is shown: only a
  scheduled refresh MAY say the library is more than 48 hours old, and a manual
  update MUST NOT. A damaged-database error MUST be presented as needing a
  restart, without the "left available, retry from Update Database" advice.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DBS-020 — MUST:** Never call the card database "empty" during the launch that
  follows a schema change. That launch starts with no cards (the table is rebuilt)
  and the launch-time refresh fills it a moment after the window appears, so the
  refresh MUST count as running from the moment it is scheduled, not only once it
  starts. A workspace restore that finds no cards MUST NOT run the saved search or
  raise a dialog: it waits, and runs once the refresh has filled the database and
  the trusted catalogs are requested. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Deck domain architecture

- **DECK-001 — MUST:** Keep exact-printing entries, quantities, board mutations,
  totals, and entry access in `deck/model.py`; keep stored quantities strictly
  positive integers, validate board/card identity before mutation, and leave deck
  state unchanged when a mutation raises. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-002 — MUST:** Keep TXT serialization, atomic temp-file/replace saving,
  section parsing, printing tags, resolver calls, and decklist decoding in
  `deck/io.py`; a failed overwrite MUST preserve the prior user-selected deck
  file. Opening a decklist MUST NOT assume the file is plain UTF-8: decks
  arrive from other builders and editors as UTF-8 with a byte-order mark, as
  UTF-16, and as Windows-1252, and MUST all open. A byte-order mark MUST be
  removed rather than left in the text, because an invisible character in front
  of the `// Name (format)` header hides that header, silently drops the saved
  format, and judges the deck by the wrong format's construction rules.
  Encodings MUST be selected from the raw byte-order mark, never guessed from
  content. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-003 — MUST:** Keep statistics, type classification, mana pips/sources,
  probability, curves, and sample hands in `deck/analysis.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-004 — MUST:** Keep the app's verified basic format-size, sideboard,
  copy-limit, Scryfall legality-payload normalization, banned/restricted/not-legal,
  and missing-status checks in `deck/legality.py`; UI text MUST describe these as
  available/basic checks rather than a complete rules engine or definitive
  legality certification. Construction profiles MUST NOT authorize or populate
  Search Format vocabulary. Every format this application names to the user --
  in the Format picker, the card preview's legality list, and each legality
  problem sentence -- MUST use the shared readable name from
  `core/format_names.py`, never the bare Scryfall key: the key reads wrong in
  prose ("commander decks have no sideboard") and makes one format look like
  two different things across panels. The rule-lookup key MUST still come from
  the stored format value, never from that display name.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-005 — MUST NOT:** Import `tkinter`, `sqlite3`, or a UI module from any
  deck module. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-006 — MUST:** Preserve entries by exact Scryfall printing ID and
  aggregate legality copy limits by Oracle ID with card-name fallback. Basic-land
  exemption MUST require the actual Basic + Land type words, and Oracle text that
  explicitly permits any number or a named maximum of the card MUST override the
  ordinary four-copy/singleton ceiling without hardcoded card names.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-007 — MUST:** Treat `[SET]`/`[SET:COLLECTOR]` TXT tags as authoritative,
  preserve saved name/format, and retain Mainboard/Sideboard/ignored sections. A
  `// Name (value)` header only sets the deck format when `value` contains a
  letter; a purely numeric parenthesized value is a card count some other builders
  emit (`// Lands (37)`), not a format, and MUST NOT overwrite the deck format.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-008 — MUST:** Preserve quantity-weighted statistics, hybrid pip
  counting, produced-mana source counting, eight curve buckets, and draw
  formulas. Deck statistics MUST classify a double-faced card by its front
  face: a stored type line holds both faces ("Sorcery // Land"), and the face
  a card is played from is the one that decides whether it fills a land slot,
  which curve bucket it occupies, and which type it is counted under. Matching
  the whole string counts every transforming permanent with a land back as a
  land. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-009 — MUST:** Keep `Deck.stats`, `Deck.to_text`, and `Deck.from_text`
  as delegation-only compatibility methods in `deck/model.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-010 — MUST NOT:** Implement deck calculations, TXT parsing, or legality
  rules in any UI module. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-012 — MUST:** Tell the user which of a deck's cards Proxic Arena
  cannot play, and keep every part of that answer in its owner. Proxic Arena
  resolves a card by name and then checks its printing: a name it has no card
  for refuses the whole import, and so does a printing it does not have, which
  ARN-011 prevents. `deck/arena_support.py` owns the lookup key and the
  comparison; `deck/arena_check.py` gathers the answer; `ui/assets.py` owns the
  built-in copy's location; `ui/arena_export.py` owns the words. The answer
  belongs to the **Proxic Arena Export** window, which is the action that states
  that intent, and `Save Deck As` MUST write an ordinary decklist and say
  nothing about Proxic Arena: a deck is saved for many reasons, most of them
  nothing to do with Arena. The key MUST mirror Proxic Arena's own lookup --
  accents stripped, lowercased, apostrophes and commas dropped, every other run
  of non-alphanumeric characters one underscore -- and MUST compare a stored
  multi-face name by its FRONT face, which is the face Proxic Arena files the
  card under. Both apostrophe spellings are dropped although Proxic Arena drops
  only one, because two spellings of one name MUST NOT read as two cards. What
  Arena plays -- its cards, the printings it accepts in the order it prefers
  them, the set codes it answers to, and its format's limits -- is Arena's own
  deck rules document (Arena specs 0021, 0022), never a list this repository
  builds, so a change on Arena's side reaches every send with no release here
  (ARN-015). `deck/arena_support.py` MUST read that document in its one shape
  wherever it came from, MUST keep each card's printings in the document's
  order, and MUST key a card's printings by the card's own name before any
  face's, because a face can share a name with another card (Emeritus of
  Conflict turns over to Lightning Bolt). `arena/connection.py` obtains it
  (ARN-012); a copy as Arena served it ships as `assets/arena/deck_rules.json`,
  located by `ui/assets.py`'s `ARENA_DECK_RULES_FILE`, for a computer never
  linked, and is refreshed only by saving Arena's own answer, never by building
  one. A missing, unreadable, or malformed rules document MUST read as "not
  known" and report nothing instead of raising. The check MUST run on the
  deck-file worker rather than on Tk (DUI-017). It MUST NOT run on
  `Save Deck As` or on JSON export, neither of which states an intent to play
  in Arena, and a deck Arena can play in full MUST say so rather than list
  nothing. The rows' wording MUST be composed apart from the widgets so the
  sentences are gated without a Tk root, and MUST cap the rows named one by one
  at `ARENA_WARNING_NAME_LIMIT`, counting the rest in one more row rather than
  dropping them. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-001 — MUST:** Give Proxic Arena everything it needs to play the deck
  and nothing it does not: one package holding the decklist at its root beside
  a `real_cards/` directory of card pictures, for the main deck alone (ARN-008),
  with the deck's token cards in the decklist's Tokens section (ARN-013) and,
  when Arena already holds some pictures, a `pictures.json` naming them instead
  (ARN-014). Arena draws a real picture only for a card whose deck brought one,
  so a bare decklist plays through Arena's own drawn cards. The package is sent
  straight to the player's Deck Depot (ARN-014). `Save Deck As` MUST remain an
  ordinary decklist write (DECK-012). _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-002 — MUST:** Name each image `<Card Name> [SET].png`, by Arena's own
  rule rather than a second spelling of it: Arena strips a trailing bracketed
  suffix and matches what remains against the card name, case-folded and with
  NO accent folding, so accents MUST be preserved exactly as printed and only
  characters a filesystem refuses MUST be removed. A stored multi-face name MUST
  be filed under its FRONT face. Because Arena keys a picture by name alone, two
  printings of one name could only collide, so the package MUST carry exactly
  ONE image per distinct card name -- the deck's own first printing of that
  name, which is the copy the player is holding. A card that turns over
  (transform, modal double-faced, battle: any card with an image on each face)
  MUST also carry its back face, named by that face's own name and the front's
  set code in the same shape, because Arena maps an image to a face by that
  face's name; split, adventure and flip cards are one picture and add nothing.
  A token card's picture is named the same way. A name already filed keeps its
  first image. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-003 — MUST:** Download that art through `printing/service.py`, which
  already downloads, validates, caches and atomically replaces Scryfall's
  high-quality PNG per exact printing under the throttling and retry policy of
  `core/net.py`. `arena/export.py` MUST take that downloader, and the two face
  functions `back_faces` and `ensure_face_png`, as arguments rather than import
  them, so it owns naming and packaging while the cache, the HTTP policy and the
  face handling stay with their owner and a send re-downloads nothing printing
  already holds, a back face included. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-004 — MUST:** Treat missing art as incomplete, never as failure. A card
  whose image cannot be fetched MUST be counted in the sent message and MUST NOT
  stop the send: the deck is still worth having and Arena draws its own card for
  exactly that case. The package is built in memory and nothing is written to
  disk on the way (ARN-014). _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-005 — MUST:** Keep the send off Tk and interruptible. It downloads one
  image per distinct card, which is tens of seconds of network for an ordinary
  deck, so it MUST run on a deck-file worker (DUI-017), report progress to Tk
  through a queue rather than touching widgets from the worker, offer Cancel
  while pictures are fetched and packed, and honour that cancel through
  `core/background_jobs.check_cancel` with an exception derived from
  `JobCancelled` (BGJ-004). Once the upload itself starts Cancel is disabled,
  because Arena could already be importing. However the send ends, including on
  failure, the window MUST come back to a state the player can act on.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-006 — MUST:** Hold everything a send needs in one window, opened by the
  **Proxic Arena Export** button beside Print Deck in the menu bar (role
  `menu_action`); the File menu MUST NOT carry a Proxic Arena item (owner
  decision 2026-10-27). In order: this computer's link (ARN-012), the deck's
  name on Arena (ARN-014), DECK CHECK (DECK-012, ARN-007 to ARN-011), TOKENS
  YOUR CARDS MAKE (ARN-010), and a footer with where the rules came from, why
  sending is off when it is, **Send to Arena** and **Close**; after a send, a
  banner saying what reached the Deck Depot and **Open Deck Depot**. The window
  is app-owned and dark, never a native `messagebox`: created hidden-first
  (WIN-006), headed through the shared gold `DialogTitle.TLabel` (UI-014),
  coloured from `PALETTE` alone (CLR-001), its content in a `ScrollZone` so the
  footer stays on screen, with one compact secondary `Close` (UI-012). It is
  not modal, there is at most one, and it follows the deck the player is
  working on: it MUST check again whenever that deck changes (its change
  count), so a red row can be fixed with the window open (owner decision
  2026-10-27). All of its words MUST be composed apart from its widgets.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-007 — MUST:** Keep **Send to Arena** off while Proxic Arena's import
  would refuse the deck, by the limits in Arena's own deck rules (DECK-012),
  never numbers kept here: a main deck smaller than its smallest or larger than
  its largest (60 to 65 cards today), more than its copy limit of one card name
  (4 today) with only the basic lands it lists exempt -- a card whose text
  allows any number, such as Relentless Rats, is held to the limit as Arena
  holds it -- a Contraption or Attraction side deck holding some cards but fewer
  than its smallest, or two of one card, or a card Arena cannot play. Each such
  problem is a red row in plain words -- the deck's size, each over-limit card
  by name, each short side deck, each unplayable card -- and the footer says to
  fix them. Side-deck cards, which Arena reads as its rules list them, and token
  cards (ARN-013) are not in the main deck's count. Only the main board counts,
  because the sideboard is not sent (ARN-008). Copies are counted per name as
  Arena resolves it -- the front face, by `deck/arena_support.py`'s key -- so
  printings and faces of one card add together. A legendary card is held to the
  same limit, and repeating one is a warning rather than a refusal (ARN-009).
  `deck/arena_limits.py` owns the measurement and reads every number from the
  rules, measured on a detached snapshot on the worker, never the live deck.
  `Save Deck As` and JSON export MUST NOT apply these limits (DECK-012), and the
  legality panel keeps its own per-format rules. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-008 — MUST:** Send the main deck alone, because Proxic Arena has no
  sideboard: the decklist MUST omit the `Sideboard` section, the package MUST
  hold no art for a card only the sideboard holds, and the size, copy and
  playability checks (ARN-007, DECK-012) MUST look at that same main deck. When
  the deck has sideboard cards the window MUST say, in plain words and with
  their count, that the sideboard stays here; a deck with none MUST NOT mention
  a sideboard. `Save Deck As` and JSON export MUST keep the sideboard
  (DECK-012). _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-009 — MUST:** Warn, and never refuse, when the main deck holds more than
  one copy of a legendary permanent's name. A legendary permanent is a card with
  the Legendary supertype and a permanent type (artifact, battle, creature,
  enchantment, land or planeswalker) on any face; a legendary instant or sorcery
  never enters play and is not one. Printings and faces of one name add
  together, as in ARN-007. `deck/arena_limits.py` finds the repeated cards;
  `ui/arena_export.py` words a warning row per card with its copy count, saying
  that only one can be controlled at a time and that Arena asks the player to
  discard the other, capped with the remainder counted. A deck with no repeated
  legendary permanent MUST NOT mention the legend rule. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-010 — MUST:** Tell the player which tokens the deck's cards make, and
  whether the deck brings each one's picture: in a game Arena dresses a token in
  the picture of a token card of the same name a deck brought (Arena spec 0022,
  owner decision S4: by name only, the controller's deck first, then the other
  player's). A token the deck's cards make with no token card of that name in
  the main deck MUST be a warning -- it still plays, drawn without a picture --
  and MUST NEVER stop a send (owner decision S5). The tokens come from each
  card's `related_parts` entries whose component is `token`, parsed through
  `core/scryfall_json.py`, never a second parser; only the main deck is read
  (ARN-008); tokens of one name and type line are one entry that names the deck
  cards able to make it, capped with the remainder counted. `deck/arena_tokens.py`
  finds and matches them; `ui/arena_export.py` words a row per token and offers
  **Find token**, which searches for token cards of that name with the Search
  Scope set to Tokens. Only the window names them (ARN-016). A deck whose cards
  make no token and that holds no token card MUST NOT mention tokens. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-011 — MUST:** Send a printing Proxic Arena accepts for every main-deck
  card, because Arena checks the printing as well as the name and one mismatch
  refuses the whole import; Arena stays strict, so the send adapts (owner
  decision, 2026-10-23). A line `N Name [SET:NUM]` is accepted when Arena's
  rules map SET to an edition holding that card at exactly NUM; a line with no
  set resolves by name and is always accepted. A printing Arena has MUST be sent
  as the deck holds it. Otherwise the send MUST use, in order: the same set with
  Arena's number; else the first printing in the order Arena's rules list them
  (Arena decides which it prefers, ARN-015) among those Scryfall also has, so
  its picture can be fetched; else the card's name alone. The set code written
  MUST be one Arena accepts for the chosen printing, and the image bundled
  (ARN-002) MUST be the chosen printing's. `deck/arena_printings.py` decides,
  from the rules (DECK-012) and the stored printings of a name read through
  `database/queries.py`'s `printings_named`, injected and run on the worker;
  `ui/arena_export.py` lists the changes in one information row,
  `Name: SET NUM → SET NUM`, capped with the remainder counted, and says the
  saved deck keeps its own printings. Only the send changes: the saved deck,
  `Save Deck As` and JSON export MUST keep the player's printings, and a deck
  needing no change MUST NOT mention printings. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-012 — MUST:** Follow the deck rules of the Proxic Arena this computer is
  linked to, and link inside the export window. Linking is Arena's (its specs
  0021, 0022): Arena's Account page makes a one-time code, the player types it
  into the window's link form with a name for this computer (Arena's address
  is set, and changed under **Change**), and Arena answers with a device token
  that downloads the rules, reads the player's deck names, asks which pictures
  their decks hold, and sends a deck -- nothing else. The player's password
  MUST never be asked for here. `arena/connection.py` owns the link: the address
  MUST be https, or http only to this computer itself (a local Arena), and no
  request carrying the token MAY follow a redirect; the token MUST be kept
  through `core/secret_store.py`, sealed to the Windows user (DPAPI), and an
  unreadable or foreign sealed token reads as not linked. When the window opens
  the rules MUST be asked for on a worker (DUI-017), offering the saved copy's
  ETag so an unchanged answer re-sends nothing; a fresh copy replaces the saved
  one only once it reads as a rules document. Arena unreachable, or not linked:
  the saved copy, else the copy built into the program, so the check never
  waits on or fails for a server. Arena refusing the token means the player
  removed this computer, so the link MUST be forgotten and the window says so.
  The footer MUST say in plain words where the rules came from. A linked window
  shows who it is linked as with **Unlink**, which forgets the link here and
  MUST say that removing it on Arena's Account page stops it there too.
  `ui/arena_connection.py` owns the form and the linked line.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-013 — MUST:** Send the main deck's token cards as pictures, not cards:
  they go in the decklist's Tokens section (`// Tokens`, after the deck, one
  line per token name) with their pictures, so Arena can dress tokens in play
  (Arena spec 0022); they are never counted toward the deck's size, never in
  the copy limit and never checked as cards. An emblem or art card is neither a
  card nor a token picture and is left out, and the window says so. Which
  entries are which is the card database's own `content_kind`, never a second
  reading of the type line; `deck/arena_tokens.py`'s `split_for_arena` divides a
  snapshot before anything else reads it, and `deck/io.py` writes the section.
  The saved deck keeps them; `Save Deck As` and JSON export are unchanged.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-014 — MUST:** Send a deck straight to the player's Deck Depot, with no
  file saved anywhere: no file dialog, no zip on disk, and no zip option in any
  menu (owner decisions S1, S6, 2026-10-27). The deck's name on Arena starts as
  the deck's own name and MAY be changed in the window; it names Arena's copy
  only, never the deck here. When the player's Deck Depot already has a deck by
  that name (compared as Arena compares names, case and surrounding spaces
  ignored) the window MUST say so before sending, MUST offer the next free
  `Name N`, and MUST keep **Send to Arena** off until the name is free: the deck
  goes in as a new deck and the other stays as it is (owner decision S2). Arena
  stays the authority: a name it reports taken, the same package already held,
  a refusal with Arena's own reasons, a removed link and an unreachable server
  MUST each be told in plain words. Before packing, the send MUST ask Arena
  which of the deck's pictures the player's decks already hold and leave those
  out, naming them by SHA-256 in `pictures.json`, so a big deck stays under the
  upload limit; when that question fails, every picture is sent.
  `arena/connection.py` owns the requests and `arena/export.py` the package.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-015 — MUST NOT:** Know anything of the game engine Proxic Arena runs
  (Forge). Every instruction this program follows about Arena -- which cards and
  printings it plays, the order it prefers printings in, the set codes it
  accepts, its deck limits, its token pictures -- comes from Arena (its deck
  rules document and its answers), so only Arena tracks engine updates (owner
  decision 2026-10-27). No module, string or comment under `mtgdb/` MAY name
  that engine or restate one of its rules, and no tool or workflow here MAY
  read its files. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **ARN-016 — MUST NOT:** Name Proxic Arena to a player anywhere but the
  **Proxic Arena Export** window (`ui/arena_export.py`, `ui/arena_connection.py`)
  and the menu bar button that opens it (owner decision 2026-10-27). The deck
  panel, Search, the dialogs and every other screen say nothing about Arena and
  behave as they would without it: the board headings count every card, token
  cards included, and sort them like any other row. Wizards' MTG Arena, a
  different game, is unaffected (the Paper / Arena / MTGO printing filter).
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DECK-011 — MUST:** Apply deck-construction checks only for explicitly
  verified format profiles. Current Brawl and Competitive Brawl MUST use exactly
  100 cards, singleton construction, and no sideboard; Commander/Commander 1v1
  MUST use 100-card singleton construction; Oathbreaker MUST use 60-card singleton
  construction. A dynamically discovered format without a verified profile MUST
  report construction rules as unverified and MUST NOT inherit a guessed 60-card,
  four-copy, 15-card-sideboard profile. Missing Scryfall status for any selected
  format MUST be surfaced as incomplete card-legality verification.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Deck editor UI architecture

- **DUI-001 — MUST:** Keep deck-pane construction, deck tabs, session switching,
  board selection/mutation callbacks, table reconciliation, and metadata
  presentation in `ui/deck.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-002 — MUST:** Keep stats-pane construction, curve/mana rendering, draw
  odds, sample-hand interaction, and legality presentation in `ui/deck_stats.py`. Mana Curve Total/By Type/By Color radio choices MUST use the header-matched choice style so they do not render a separate dark rectangle behind the controls.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-003 — MUST:** Compose `DeckBuilderApp` with `DeckEditorMixin`,
  `DeckFileWorkflowMixin`, and `DeckStatsMixin`; do not redefine their owned
  methods in `ui/app.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-004 — MUST:** Route add/quantity/remove/board-move through the public
  `Deck` API, mark the session dirty, and reconcile only affected views before
  refreshing shared statistics. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-005 — MUST:** Preserve exact-printing row identity, native highlighted-row
  selection, the focused row as the preview/odds primary, and preview stability
  during deck sorting/filtering and batch mutations. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-006 — MUST:** Obtain composition metrics, curves, mana counts, draw
  probabilities, hands, and legality problems from `deck/analysis.py` or
  `deck/legality.py`, never reimplemented in a UI callback. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-007 — MUST:** Keep Mainboard/Sideboard sorting and filtering independent
  and route shared schema/formatting/headings/columns through `ui/tables.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-008 — MUST:** Clear a stale sample hand after a mutation, close its
  read-only large-card window, reject a stale hidden deck-row selection, draw only
  from the current mainboard quantities, and hydrate each drawn exact printing from
  the current database before image presentation. Keep sideboard-only cards out of
  mainboard draw probabilities and sample hands. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-009 — MUST NOT:** Implement deck TXT serialization, workspace
  persistence, print export, or DB schema behavior in `ui/deck.py` or
  `ui/deck_stats.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-010 — MUST:** Keep filter-independent deck TXT open/import, deck save dialogs,
  and JSON projection/export in `ui/deck_files.py`; keep shutdown and cross-feature
  composition in `ui/app.py`; route print export through `ui/printing.py`, workspace
  persistence through `workspace/repository.py`, Search-state adaptation through
  `ui/search.py`, and workspace/session/geometry adaptation through `ui/workspace.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-011 — MUST:** Keep mana pip drawing, bundled mana-symbol loading,
  fallback-symbol rendering, mana-filter disabled-image state, and mana-cost Tk image composition in `ui/mana.py`,
  composed through `ManaSymbolsMixin` by `DeckBuilderApp`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-012 — MUST:** Place `View Hand` beside `Draw Hand`, keep it disabled until
  a sample hand exists, and open the current hand through the shared fixed
  `CardComparisonWindow` read-only card-grid path without adding the hand to or
  removing anything from `ComparisonCollection`; duplicate copies in the seven-card
  hand MUST remain separately visible and MUST retain visible art even when copies
  share one image request/cache key. The inline sample-hand list MUST show each
  card name, display all seven drawn rows without its own vertical scrollbar, and rely
  on the Deck Stats pane scrollbar when more vertical room is needed. The inline Sample
  Hand MAY expose a horizontal scrollbar only while user-resized columns exceed its
  visible width, so dragged-wide Card text remains reachable without clipping; the read-only
  large-card grid MUST omit card names and the top-of-window card count. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-013 — MUST:** Keep Mainboard and Sideboard Treeviews in native `extended`
  selection mode with one board owning the active highlighted batch at a time. `+`
  increments every highlighted exact printing, `–` decrements each highlighted
  quantity without deleting its final copy, and `Remove` MUST delete every
  highlighted deck entry completely regardless of quantity. After removal, if a
  visible row remains, selection MUST advance to the row now occupying the focused
  removed row's position (or the preceding final row). The board-move action moves
  the complete highlighted batch then reselects it on the destination board. A multi-row context menu says `Search for these cards` and routes every
  selected distinct name through the Search exact-name batch preset. Results,
  Mainboard, and Sideboard context menus MUST NOT expose comparison membership
  actions; the dedicated comparison bar is the only add-selected path. All deck
  mutations route through the public `Deck` API. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **DUI-014 — MUST:** Present deck format as a single-choice picker button whose
  popup uses radio controls and that
  consumes the same live `_format_catalog` used by Search Format. Format labels MUST
  capitalize their first displayed letter. A saved deck format MAY remain visible
  when it is absent from the current catalog, but it MUST NOT be appended to or
  authorize the trusted Search/deck picker vocabulary. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **DUI-015 — MUST:** Opening a deck TXT from either File -> Open Deck or the
  deck-pane `+` -> Open Deck TXT action MUST use the same `_open_deck` workflow and
  resolve untagged card names against the complete local card database, independent
  of all current Search criteria, Search Printings selections, platform/language
  scope, Set Type, Exact Set, or any other interactive filter state. The import path
  MUST NOT open or consume a Printings/filter picker. Resolver ranking MAY choose the
  best conventional printing from the unrestricted candidate set, while explicit
  `[SET]` and `[SET:COLLECTOR]` tags remain authoritative exact-printing requests.
  Untagged name resolution MUST remain Cards-only through the resolver's normal
  non-card-layout guard, so a bare name never resolves to a token/emblem/art-series
  printing. An explicit `[SET]`/`[SET:COLLECTOR]` tag MAY resolve a non-card
  (token/emblem/art-series) printing when the tagged row exists: decks this app
  exports carry their own tokens as tagged entries, so a deck round-trip MUST NOT
  silently drop them. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **DUI-016 — MUST:** Do not render a duplicate `N main · N side` count above the
  deck boards. The section headings MUST display `MAINBOARD | N CARDS` and
  `SIDEBOARD | N CARDS` using current board quantities after every deck refresh.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-017 — MUST:** Keep user-selected file dialogs on Tk but execute deck TXT
  reading/resolution, TXT serialization/durability, and JSON export disk work on
  Tk-free deck-file workers using detached deck snapshots. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-018 — MUST:** Compute the common Deck Stats aggregates from one
  deck-generation analysis snapshot rather than repeatedly sorting/traversing the
  same deck for composition, mana curve, pips, sources, and opening-land metrics.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-019 — MUST:** Never discard a deck session on the strength of a merely
  submitted save. When closing a dirty session, `_confirm_close_session` MUST
  wait for the deck-file write to complete and MUST keep the session open when
  it fails, so a rejected path (read-only folder, full disk, disconnected
  share) cannot destroy the only copy of a deck. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUI-020 — MUST NOT:** Report background work as finished when it has only
  been submitted. A `ui/` method that hands work to a deck-file worker MUST NOT
  return a truthy constant standing for that work's outcome. Moving work off Tk
  under DUI-017 changes a return value from "this happened" to "this started",
  so every caller that acts on the outcome — discarding a session, removing a
  file, clearing dirty state — MUST receive the completed result instead, the
  way `_save_session_as(wait=True)` serves DUI-019. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Workspace and deck-session architecture

- **WSP-001 — MUST:** Represent every open deck with `DeckSession` and manage the
  collection with `DeckSessionManager` in `deck/sessions.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-002 — MUST:** Keep `deck/sessions.py` free of Tk, SQLite, workspace file
  IO, DB access, and UI modules. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-003 — MUST:** Keep versioned schema projection, payload signatures,
  atomic JSON replacement, recovery retention, and corrupt-primary fallback in
  `workspace/repository.py`; reject unsupported workspace schema versions and
  give every retained recovery snapshot a collision-safe distinct path.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-004 — MUST NOT:** Import Tk, SQLite, a UI module, or `CardDB` from
  `workspace/repository.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-005 — MUST:** Keep Search widget-state capture/restore in `ui/search.py`;
  keep only the retained Mainboard/Sideboard sash capture/restore, restored-result
  selection, workspace/session coordination, and Tk autosave scheduling in
  `ui/workspace.py`. The deterministic main and center layout MUST NOT persist or
  restore obsolete main/middle sash positions.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-006 — MUST NOT:** Open, write, replace, remove, or enumerate workspace
  files from `ui/app.py`, `ui/deck.py`, or `ui/workspace.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-007 — MUST:** Maintain at least one session and exactly one valid active
  index after init/append/activate/remove/restore. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-008 — MUST:** Preserve each session's deck, optional path, dirty state,
  selected row, and independent Mainboard/Sideboard filters and sorts. Deck
  column sorts and table filters are written directly to the live UI state and
  are not stored in a session until a capture runs, so any operation that ends
  by reloading a session over those widgets MUST capture the active session
  first — including when the deck being closed is not the active one.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-009 — MUST:** Preserve workspace schema version 1, exact printing IDs,
  names, formats, quantities, boards, active-tab index, search state, and the
  retained Mainboard/Sideboard sash geometry. Older saved main/middle sash keys
  MAY be read but MUST be ignored by the deterministic main layout.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-010 — MUST:** Load the primary workspace first and, when missing/invalid,
  restore the newest valid recovery snapshot. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-011 — MUST:** Suppress unchanged routine rewrites, retain at most eight
  recovery snapshots, and allow forced writes during shutdown; once the atomic
  primary session succeeds, a supplemental recovery-snapshot failure MUST be
  logged without converting that successful primary save into a failure.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-012 — MUST:** Write automatic workspace data only beneath the portable
  `data` directory, replacing files atomically with collision-safe temp paths.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-013 — MUST:** Access open-deck state through `DeckSessionManager` and
  typed `DeckSession` attributes; legacy dict/session-index collections are
  prohibited. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-014 — MUST:** Tk MUST capture only a cheap detached structural workspace
  snapshot and submit it to the latest-wins workspace writer. Deep JSON-safe
  shaping, JSON serialization, temporary-file IO, `flush`/`fsync`, recovery
  history, and atomic replacement MUST execute off the Tk thread; forced shutdown
  MUST flush the newest submitted snapshot. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WSP-015 — MUST:** Workspace startup load, JSON parsing, validation, recovery
  fallback, and exact-printing hydration MUST execute off Tk. Tk applies one
  completed immutable restore result and MUST NOT enable autosave until that
  restore attempt has completed. Application shutdown MUST invalidate and join an
  active workspace loader before the shared card database is closed.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Comparison architecture

- **CMP-001 — MUST:** Keep ordered exact-printing comparison state, limits,
  mutations, and typed results in `comparison/models.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-002 — MUST:** Preserve and enforce the two-card minimum and seven-card
  maximum, including constructor inputs outside that range, plus insertion order,
  exact printing identity, and separate entries for same-name different-printing
  cards. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-003 — MUST:** Keep `comparison/models.py` limited to comparison state
  and the JSON list parsing the image path needs; it holds no card-attribute,
  legality, symbol, or type-line display logic. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-004 — MUST NOT:** Import `tkinter`, `sqlite3`, `core/net.py`, or any
  `mtgdb.ui.*` module from `comparison/models.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-005 — MUST:** Keep global comparison-bar construction, mixed-source
  selection collection, context actions, mutation callbacks, status, menu rebuilding,
  and window coordination in `ui/comparison_controls.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-006 — MUST:** Compose `ComparisonCollection` and `ComparisonFeatureMixin`
  from `ui/app.py` without defining comparison mutation/tray/menu/window methods on
  `DeckBuilderApp`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-007 — MUST:** Read comparison cards via `ComparisonCollection.cards()`
  from `ui/comparison.py` and keep mutation out of that module.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-008 — MUST:** Render each compared printing in `ui/comparison.py` as its
  image and contextual deck/source actions without a redundant card-name label,
  top card-count label, or generic per-card comparison-membership `Remove` button.
  Deck-origin cards display the exact originating Mainboard/Sideboard plus its live
  exact-printing quantity and expose one matching `Remove from …` action while copies
  remain; Search-origin cards expose `Add Mainboard` and `Add Sideboard`. Read-only
  card-grid views render image only, without mutation actions or card-name labels.
  Request images through the shared image service, reuse Tk PhotoImages, and reject
  stale results by generation. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-009 — MUST NOT:** Add card-attribute rows, disclosure sections,
  difference highlighting, a differences-only filter, or a face-selection or any
  other dropdown to the comparison window. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-010 — MUST:** Keep comparison membership separate from native Treeview
  selection. Results, Mainboard, and Sideboard MUST retain independent native
  highlights. The dedicated comparison bar lives in the deck workspace and contains
  `Add Selected`, compared-count/manage, `Compare`, and `Clear` at standard action
  density. `Add Selected` MUST gather the union of highlighted Results/Mainboard/
  Sideboard exact printings, deduplicate exact printing IDs, preserve deck-source
  provenance when available, enforce the seven-card cap, stay disabled while the
  highlighted selection cannot fit within that cap (CMP-016), and MUST NOT clear
  source highlights when cards are added. `Clear` MUST clear both comparison membership and
  current Results/Mainboard/Sideboard highlights, and MUST remain enabled when either
  source selections or compared cards exist. Preserve compared-count menu removal,
  min/max messages, insertion order, and modeless refresh. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-011 — MUST:** Keep comparison/read-only card-grid windows at one
  count-independent, screen-clamped locked size using the shared 1840×1120 target.
  At standard 96-DPI-equivalent Tk scaling, comparison card art MUST use the same
  340×480 portrait target as the main Card Preview whenever the available screen can
  fit it, including a 1920×1080 desktop after screen clamping. At elevated Tk scaling,
  the layout MUST reserve enough side-rail width for every complete provenance/action
  label and proportionally reduce card art before clipping an action. Keep provenance
  and mutation actions beside each image so two rows do not consume the image-height budget;
  scale images down proportionally only when a smaller display requires it. Use at
  most four image columns and wrap five through seven cards to a second row. Add no
  horizontal or vertical scrollbar or scrolling Canvas.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-012 — MUST:** Present comparison minimum/maximum notices through an
  app-owned dark dialog using `PALETTE` and shared button components; native
  `messagebox` dialogs are prohibited for comparison notices. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-013 — MUST:** When a card is added to comparison from a deck board, keep
  its originating `DeckSession` and exact source board in
  `ui/comparison_controls.py`; do not infer provenance from another board that happens
  to contain the same printing. Report the source board's live quantity. Each source
  removal removes exactly one copy, deletes the board entry only when its quantity
  reaches zero, routes through the public `Deck` API, marks that source session dirty,
  refreshes visible views when active, and MUST NOT remove the card from comparison.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-014 — MUST:** Reuse `CardComparisonWindow` for read-only large-card grids
  such as the sample opening hand. Static-grid cards MUST preserve list order and
  duplicate instances, use the same fixed scrollbar-free geometry/image service,
  omit card-name labels, and MUST NOT mutate or consume `ComparisonCollection`.
  The shared comparison/read-only window header MUST NOT show a card-count label and
  MUST render its title in the same gold accent/dialog-title typography used by the
  Mechanics and Subtype picker windows.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-015 — MUST:** A compared card with no valid deck-source provenance
  offers `Add Mainboard` / `Add Sideboard` against the currently active deck. Each
  click adds exactly one copy through the public `Deck` API, marks the active session
  dirty, refreshes the affected board, and leaves the card in comparison.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CMP-016 — MUST:** Refuse an over-cap comparison add visibly instead of
  silently truncating it. Count the highlighted Results/Mainboard/Sideboard
  printings that are not already compared; when that count plus the compared
  count exceeds the seven-card maximum, `ui/comparison_controls.py` MUST disable
  `Add Selected`, append ` (TOO MANY CARDS SELECTED)` to the canonical comparison count
  heading, and colour that heading palette alert red through a shared
  `ui/styles.py` label style rather than a local font or colour. Re-highlighting
  an already-compared printing MUST NOT count toward the overflow, because adding
  it again changes nothing. The alert MUST pulse between the bright and dimmed
  alert reds a bounded number of times on each crossing and then hold the bright
  red; it MUST NOT animate without end, restart while the selection stays over
  the cap, or leave a pending timer after the heading is destroyed. Returning
  within the cap MUST restore the heading's normal text and style.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Card detail and interactive image architecture

- **IMG-001 — MUST:** Route main-preview and comparison image requests through
  the single `CardImageService` owned by the app. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-002 — MUST NOT:** Import `tkinter` or construct a Tk image from
  `images/service.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-003 — MUST:** Limit interactive image work to four daemon workers
  (spawned via `core/background_jobs.spawn_daemon`) and logically cancel queued
  requests during shutdown. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-004 — MUST:** Deduplicate identical in-flight requests, serialize disk
  writes to the same path, and maintain independent weighted LRUs for decoded source
  and processed images. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-005 — MUST:** Validate downloaded images and replace cache files
  atomically through collision-safe paths from `core/cache_names.py`; never treat
  an existing unindexed cache file as belonging to a requested printing.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-006 — MUST NOT:** Perform direct network, cache-file, PIL decoding, or
  worker-thread ops from `ui/card_detail.py` or `ui/comparison.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-007 — MUST:** Reject stale preview/comparison image results by request
  token, face selection, and comparison generation before changing a widget.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-008 — MUST:** Preserve automatic landscape rotation policy, double-faced
  face selection, text fallback, playable-format legality interpretation, and
  ordinary-preview image size constraints. Card-preview legality MUST accept both
  stored JSON text and already decoded legality mappings through `deck/legality.py`
  rather than silently displaying no legal formats for one representation. Manual
  preview rotation MUST compose with, not replace, the automatic posture.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-009 — MUST NOT:** Define main card-pane construction, preview, fallback,
  legality popup/presentation, or image-completion methods on `DeckBuilderApp`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-010 — MUST:** Remove abandoned `*.download` image-cache partials when
  the image service starts and give worker threads a bounded shutdown join without
  permitting new requests after shutdown begins. The sweep MUST recurse into
  nested cache directories: the print-template cache is a `print_png`
  subdirectory using the same partial-file convention, and its orphans carry
  distinct per-card names, so a top-level-only scan lets them accumulate
  permanently. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-011 — MUST:** Expose `Gallery`, `Legality`, `Rotate`, and `Zoom` actions in the main
  card preview. `Gallery` MUST use the compact primary/gold action role beside Legality and open the current Results image grid defined by SRCH-046. The preview surface MUST NOT reserve a persistent inline legality
  text row. `Legality` opens a small app-owned dark popup listing the previewed
  card's playable formats, including the restricted distinction; Rotate cycles
  clockwise quarter turns while preserving the card's automatic base posture and
  MUST fit every rotated main-preview image inside the fixed 340×480 preview box
  rather than widening/clipping the center column; Zoom
  opens a dark modeless viewer with bounded zoom/panning and routes every
  resize/rotation through `CardImageService`, with final `ImageTk` conversion only
  in `ui/card_detail.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-012 — MUST:** Keep the main Card Preview container borderless: the shared
  `Preview.TFrame` uses zero border width and flat relief, with no surrounding box
  around the Card Preview surface. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-013 — MUST:** Treat the main card preview as a latest-wins image-request
  channel. A newer main-preview request MUST cancel older queued work that has no
  other consumer and MUST receive higher queue priority than unscoped background
  image work; deduplicated requests used by comparison, zoom, or another unscoped
  consumer MUST remain protected. Running worker calls MAY finish, but stale results
  MUST still be rejected by the preview request token. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-014 — MUST:** Keep deferred Tk image-ready retries separate from the main
  image-event-pump scheduling slot. A deferred callback MUST clear its own `after`
  handle before re-entering image completion, new selections MUST cancel obsolete
  ready retries, and move/resize or iconic deferral MUST NOT prevent later preview
  futures from being polled. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-015 — MUST:** Use a 96 MiB processed-image budget and 32 MiB decoded-source
  budget with conservative `width × height × 4` weighting, plus secondary ceilings
  of 256 processed variants and 32 decoded sources. Byte limits are authoritative.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-016 — MUST:** An image larger than its cache budget MUST still decode, resize,
  and display successfully but MUST NOT be retained. Cache locks protect lookup, LRU
  promotion, insertion, byte accounting, and eviction only; decoding/resizing stays
  outside the lock. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **IMG-017 — MUST:** Keep the UI mana-cost PhotoImage cache bounded while preserving
  identical symbol rendering. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Printing workflow architecture

- **PRN-001 — MUST:** Keep physical/page geometry, grid placement, cut borders,
  page counting, and atomic PDF rendering in `printing/renderer.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-002 — MUST:** Preserve 2.5×3.5 in cards, a 3×3 grid, nine per page, the
  cutting gap, rounded hairline borders, and aspect-preserving placement.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-003 — MUST:** Write incomplete PDF output through the PORT-007 durable
  replace pattern, publish the PDF only after complete rendering, and remove
  incomplete output after success/failure/cancel. PORT-007 owns the temporary
  naming and durability mechanism; this rule owns only the render lifecycle,
  so no fixed `.part` filename is specified here. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-004 — MUST:** Keep snapshot creation, board expansion, PNG validation,
  download orchestration, render coordination, typed events, and worker lifecycle
  in `printing/service.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-005 — MUST:** Capture print jobs before background execution with
  mainboard before sideboard, quantity expansion intact, and every available
  exact printing ID preserved. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-006 — MUST:** Use `core/cache_names.py` for print PNG paths, validate
  cached/downloaded PNGs, replace corrupt files, and keep separate files per
  exact printing. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-007 — MUST:** Permit one print worker, tag events by generation, coalesce
  progress before Tk, and deliver terminal success/failure/cancel through the
  controller queue. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-008 — MUST:** Cooperatively cancel incomplete print work during shutdown
  and remove partial image/PDF output. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-009 — MUST:** Keep destination selection, progress dialog, Tk polling,
  completion/error presentation, and shutdown adaptation in `ui/printing.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-010 — MUST NOT:** Import network transport, cache naming, ReportLab,
  queue management, or worker construction into `ui/printing.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-011 — MUST:** Compose `PrintTemplateService`, `PrintController`, and
  `PrintingMixin` in `ui/app.py`, retain the Print Deck menu command, and delegate
  print methods off `DeckBuilderApp`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PRN-012 — MUST NOT:** Import Tk into `printing/renderer.py` or
  `printing/service.py`, or import network transport, cache naming, deck state,
  or worker management into `printing/renderer.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Background-job infrastructure

- **BGJ-001 — MUST:** Keep the shared cancellation exception (`JobCancelled`),
  cooperative cancel check (`check_cancel`), daemon-thread factory
  (`spawn_daemon`), and the generation-tagged single-worker controller
  (`GenerationalWorker`) in `core/background_jobs.py`; route print and database-sync
  cooperative cancellation checks through `check_cancel`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DUR-001 — MUST:** Sweep the temporary files an interrupted atomic write
  leaves behind. Every durable writer creates a temporary beside its target,
  fsyncs it, and replaces the target in one step, so no reader ever sees a
  half-written file. That shape cannot clean up after a process killed
  between the two steps: the `finally` never runs and the temporary stays in
  the portable folder the user is told to copy between machines. Bulk
  downloads sweep their own; the workspace, preferences and deck-file
  writers MUST sweep theirs through `core/atomic_files.py`. A sweep MUST
  name the prefixes it removes: a folder can hold another application's
  temporaries, and deleting those is worse than the litter this prevents.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BGJ-002 — MUST:** Keep `core/background_jobs.py` Tk-free and free of feature
  imports; it is the shared base. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BGJ-003 — MUST:** Derive `PrintController` and `DatabaseSyncController` from
  `GenerationalWorker`, delegating generation counting, event queueing, cancel,
  and shutdown to the base. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BGJ-004 — MUST:** Subclass subsystem cancellation exceptions
  (`PrintCancelled`, `DatabaseSyncCancelled`) from `JobCancelled` so callers can
  catch either. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BGJ-005 — MUST:** Create image, print, and sync worker threads through
  `spawn_daemon`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BGJ-006 — MUST:** Preserve the single-worker limit, generation tagging, and
  coalesced progress of printing and syncing across changes to the shared base.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Shared table architecture

- **TBL-001 — MUST:** Define columns, default visibility, display formatting, and
  sort-key behavior in `ui/tables.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-002 — MUST:** Route reads and atomic writes of UI preferences through
  `UIPreferencesRepository` in `preferences/repository.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-003 — MUST NOT:** Import `tkinter` from `preferences/repository.py` or
  perform preference-file IO from `ui/app.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-004 — MUST:** Keep Results, Mainboard, and Sideboard on the single schema
  and behavior contract exported by `ui/tables.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-005 — MUST:** Sanitize saved layouts, reject unknown/duplicate column
  IDs, migrate older layouts, and retain at least one usable column per table.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-006 — MUST:** Keep Cost as the protected non-draggable tree column when
  visible. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-007 — MUST:** Persist visibility/reset/reorder without changing unrelated
  preference keys. One `Reset` action MUST restore default visible columns, default
  display order, and canonical width/minimum/stretch geometry for every physical
  column in that table; repeated Reset clicks MUST NOT be required.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-008 — MUST NOT:** Define shared table formatting/sorting/heading/
  column-popup/visibility/reorder methods on `DeckBuilderApp`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-009 — MUST:** Keep every configurable Results card-data column
  synchronized with `SearchRepository.SEARCH_RESULT_COLUMNS`; adding or removing
  a shared card-data table field requires inspecting both `ui/tables.py` and
  `search/repository.py` so the narrow Results projection supplies the value.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-010 — MUST:** A column-filter popup MUST expose `Clear This` as its
  scoped reset and MUST NOT expose a second all-table clear action inside the popup.
  `Clear This` removes only that column's filter. Each table header's `Clear Filters`
  action MUST remove every column filter for that owning Results/Mainboard/Sideboard
  view. The main Search-row `Clear` action MUST also clear every Results column filter
  and dismiss any open Results filter editor so no hidden column text/value filter survives
  a visible Search-form reset. A numeric column filter MUST refuse a reversed range
  (Minimum above Maximum) and a non-finite bound with a message inside the popup,
  leaving it open; applying a reversed range silently emptied the table.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-012 — MUST:** Read a numeric Power or Toughness column filter exactly as
  Search reads the stat: only digits, `.` and `-` are numeric (the SQL GLOB guard),
  valued as SQL `CAST` does. A printed "+1" is then in neither Search nor the table
  filter; the table used to keep a card that Search dropped.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TBL-011 — MUST:** Position every Edit Columns popup inside the visible work
  area of the physical monitor containing its anchor control. Clamp both positive
  and negative virtual-desktop coordinates and prefer opening above the anchor when
  there is insufficient room below. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## UI component system

| Semantic role | Required use |
| --- | --- |
| `standard` / `primary` | Standard-density secondary / primary action |
| `compact` / `compact_primary` | Compact secondary / primary action |
| `deck` | Deck quantity, removal, board-move controls |
| `picker` | Button/menu button representing a form choice |
| `menu_action` | The menu bar's one action button, **Proxic Arena Export** (ARN-006) |
| `dense` / `dense_primary` | Reserved dense secondary / primary family; use only where an owning layout explicitly requires dense action density |

- **UI-001 — MUST:** Use `AppButton`, `AppMenubutton`, `AppEntry`, `AppCombobox`,
  and `AppSpinbox` for ttk controls they cover. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-002 — MUST:** Use `ClassicButton`, `ClassicEntry`, `ClassicCheckbutton`,
  and `ClassicRadiobutton` when classic Tk behavior is required. Single-select
  choice rows inside a picker list viewport are the documented exception and
  MUST follow UI-010 instead. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-010 — MUST:** Render every single-select choice row inside a picker list
  viewport as a themed `ttk.Radiobutton` carrying the shared
  `ListChoice.TRadiobutton` style, whose selected and unselected indicator
  colours are supplied by `ui/styles.py`. A classic Tk radio MUST NOT be used
  for those rows: its indicator is painted by the host platform, ignores this
  palette, and leaves selected and unselected rows visually identical, so every
  row reads as selected. A palette contrast assertion on `selectcolor` does not
  detect that failure; the style's own selected/unselected indicator colours
  MUST differ and MUST be asserted. Every `Any`/`All` and
  Within/Contains/Exactly mode row MUST carry the same style, in the picker
  dialogs and in the Search form alike: sitting beside themed controls, a
  classic radio reads as a different widget family. The Match row of a Cost or
  Colors column-filter popup answers the same Any/All/None question, so it MUST be
  three `DialogChoice.TRadiobutton` radios on that popup's surface, not a dropdown
  that hides two of the answers. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-011 — MUST:** Derive the Mainboard/Sideboard display name from the single
  `deck_board_label` helper in `ui/components.py`. The wording previously existed
  as six independent conditionals across the deck pane, comparison view,
  comparison controls, and stats panel, which is how such text drifts apart.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-012 — MUST:** Treat `Close` as navigation/window-management rather than an
  affirmative action. Every visible `Close` button MUST use the secondary compact
  role; gold primary roles are reserved for affirmative actions such as Search,
  Apply, Done, OK, Gallery, or mutation commands that intentionally carry primary
  emphasis. Every visible `Close` MUST also be the same widget class, `AppButton`:
  a classic button of the same role is narrower and shorter, which left the two
  Legality dialogs with Close buttons of different sizes. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-013 — MUST:** Use Title Case for action-button labels. Count headings use one
  canonical grammar: `RESULTS | N CARDS`, `MAINBOARD | N CARDS`,
  `SIDEBOARD | N CARDS`, `RESULTS GALLERY | N CARDS`, and
  `COMPARE | N CARDS SELECTED`. A count of one reads `1 CARD`, never `1 CARDS`, and
  every such heading MUST build its count with `card_count_text` in
  `ui/components.py`, the one owner of that wording. Status text after a heading
  separator MAY remain sentence case because it is a state message rather than a
  count. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-014 — MUST:** Render major app-owned popup titles through the shared gold
  dialog-title ttk styles: `DialogTitle.TLabel` on `surface` and
  `RaisedDialogTitle.TLabel` on `surface2`. Feature code MUST NOT recreate the
  dialog-title font/color tuple locally. The database-refresh and Print progress
  popups MUST use that same title, with the sentence saying what is happening
  beneath it in `FONT_BODY_BOLD`; there is no separate progress-title font. The
  Edit Columns and column-filter panels are section headings, not major popups,
  and keep the small gold heading treatment. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-015 — MUST:** Render the Results Gallery card-size control as themed ttk
  `Gallery.Horizontal.TScale`; do not use a raw `tk.Scale` whose platform chrome
  can drift from the charcoal/gold component system. The slider MUST reserve a
  15-pixel gap on its right edge before the Gallery Close action so the controls
  never visually touch. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-016 — MUST:** Draw no scrollbar that has nothing to scroll. A dialog list MUST
  hide its scrollbar until the list overflows its viewport
  (`autohide_scrollbar` in `ui/components.py`); Results and the deck tables keep
  a fixed gutter so their width never shifts, as does the Search filter zone
  (LAY-011), but a disabled scrollbar MUST NOT paint a gold thumb: its thumb melts
  into the trough, and the filter zone's idle bar paints nothing at all. A dialog with two rows
  used to carry a full-length gold bar beside them. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-017 — MUST:** Anchor every left-justified classic `tk.Label` west.
  `justify` aligns the lines of a paragraph inside its own text block; the block
  itself is centered in a label wider than it, which indented the Print and
  database-refresh paragraphs against the title and box above and below them.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-003 — MUST:** Use `TokenBubbleEntry` for multi-value rules-text input and the
  `ui/autocomplete.py` components for autocomplete fields. `ToolTip` is the shared
  primitive only for Search-filter tooltips permitted by **SRCH-035**; feature UI
  outside Search MUST NOT introduce application-owned tooltips. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-004 — MUST NOT:** Instantiate `tk.Button`, `tk.Entry`, `tk.Checkbutton`,
  or `tk.Radiobutton` outside `ui/components.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-005 — MUST NOT:** Bypass the shared form roles with raw ttk Entry,
  Combobox, or Spinbox in feature code. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-006 — MUST:** Select button roles by interaction meaning, not color.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **UI-007 — MUST:** Add a new reusable role through tokens, styles, components,
  and contract tests when no defined role fits. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-008 — MUST:** Keep autocomplete popup behavior and the current
  `AutocompleteEntry` implementation in `ui/autocomplete.py`; popup lifecycle,
  keyboard navigation, positioning, and dismissal stay centralized there and
  `ui/components.py` defines no autocomplete widgets. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **UI-009 — MUST:** Keep set-type humanization, the reusable set-filter dialog
  shell, and flat controls for currently observed Scryfall `set_type` values in
  `ui/set_filters.py`; it MUST NOT define recommended sets, default-on membership,
  or application-authored set families/groups. Search and deck import consume this
  shared owner instead of importing each other's feature module. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Window and platform services

- **WIN-001 — MUST:** Keep popup geometry, dark title bars, global mouse-wheel
  routing, DPI/maximize, window icon, and dark-menu construction in
  `WindowServicesMixin` in `ui/window.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WIN-002 — MUST:** Compose `DeckBuilderApp` with `WindowServicesMixin` and not
  redefine its methods in `ui/app.py`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WIN-003 — MUST:** Route mouse-wheel input by the widget under the pointer.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WIN-004 — MUST:** Confine Windows-only platform calls (DWM dark title bar,
  DPI awareness) to guarded code paths in `ui/window.py`. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **WIN-005 — MUST:** Resolve a widget's physical-monitor work area in
  `ui/window.py`; on Windows use the nearest monitor's work rectangle and on other
  platforms use Tk virtual-root bounds as the fallback. Feature modules MUST consume
  this shared work-area service rather than implementing monitor APIs themselves.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WIN-006 — MUST:** Create every app-owned native `Toplevel` hidden-first, apply
  dark client/frame styling and final geometry while withdrawn, and map it only
  after its first-frame widget tree is complete. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WIN-007 — MUST NOT:** Call `update()` or `update_idletasks()` from a visible
  high-frequency `<Configure>`, sash-motion, mouse-wheel, or resize callback. A
  hidden popup geometry pass is permitted before first map. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WIN-008 — MUST:** Route root resize/move and the one retained
  Mainboard/Sideboard `PanedWindow` sash drag through one layout-motion state.
  Responsive Results repaint, stats canvas/curve redraw, and comparison/deck action
  rearrangement MUST wait for the settled-layout commit. Per-motion board-sash
  safety clamps MUST be coalesced so a fast drag cannot queue an idle callback
  backlog. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WIN-009 — MUST:** Enforce DPI-tolerant Mainboard/Sideboard minima during its
  retained sash motion and use measured widget requested widths plus expansion
  hysteresis for responsive action/chip layouts; fixed pixel breakpoints MUST NOT
  choose an arrangement that cannot fit the current DPI/font scale. The three
  mana-colour rows and both Type Line chip rows are such layouts. Controls
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **WIN-010 — MUST:** Keep controls from oscillating, clipping, or crossing the
  retained Mainboard/Sideboard divider while a person drags it. A drag is live
  interaction, so no deterministic check establishes it; WIN-009 keeps the
  measurable half — DPI-tolerant minima, measured requested widths, and
  expansion hysteresis. _Verification:_ **MANUAL**.

- **WIN-011 — MUST:** Present a size-locked dialog with `fit_content=True`, which
  raises its preferred size to what its own widgets request before the lock. A
  locked size keeps the pixels it was designed with while the text inside grows
  with display scaling, and the footer is the first thing squeezed away: Card
  Legality's Close was 21 px tall at 125% and gone at 150%. The layout flush is
  permitted because the popup is still hidden. _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.

## Color, typography, sizing

- **CLR-001 — MUST:** Use `PALETTE` in `ui/tokens.py` as the only palette source.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CLR-002 — MUST:** Use gold `accent` backgrounds only for primary actions,
  selected filter-chip state, menu hover, and text selection, always with the
  `on_accent` dark foreground; never white/light text on gold.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CLR-003 — MUST:** Use a dark surface with light `text` and the same thin
  one-pixel `border` outline used by the Rules Text field for secondary button
  controls; do not use the brighter `muted` color as the normal button box. Use
  `muted` for disabled primary text and keep secondary hover backgrounds dark. Under
  the clam theme, ttk secondary button/menubutton styles MUST use a relief that
  actually paints the configured one-pixel field-style outline rather than leaving
  the border color dormant. Gold primary buttons retain an accent-colored outline.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CLR-004 — MUST NOT:** Hard-code `on_accent` outside `ui/tokens.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CLR-005 — MUST:** Give shared clickable button and button-like menu controls
  bounded visual activation feedback: the pressed state is inset and a successful
  release receives a brief palette-based pulse before returning to its normal role
  styling. The feedback MUST NOT alter the control command or create timers that
  persist after the control is destroyed. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CLR-006 — MUST:** Keep classic-Tk and ttk secondary button families visually
  equivalent: normal secondary controls use `surface2`, hover/active uses the
  lighter `surface3`, text stays `text`, and pressed/click-pulse feedback uses the
  shared `select`/accent outline treatment. A classic secondary button MUST NOT
  darken on hover while its ttk counterpart lightens. A classic button MUST paint
  its one-pixel `border` outline (`accent` for primary roles) as a containing
  border frame, never relying on `highlightthickness`: Windows Tk drops a classic
  button's highlight ring regardless of colour or thickness, which left classic
  buttons borderless beside their bordered ttk counterparts. Outline-exempt roles
  (chip close) keep no border. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CLR-007 — MUST:** Give status TEXT one red and one green, `bad` and `good`, each
  at least 4.5:1 against both `surface` and `surface2`. `bad_bright` is the alert
  flash's brighter partner for `bad` and meets the same floor. The darker
  greens and reds this replaced measured 3.2:1 and 3.4:1 on `surface` and 3.0:1 on
  `surface2`, and error, unavailable and over-limit text used two different reds.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **CLR-008 — MUST:** Define each mana colour once, as `MANA_FILL` and `MANA_BORDER` in
  `ui/tokens.py`. The drawn mana pips and the deck-stats colour segments read
  them; `ui/mana.py` MUST NOT define a colour or a hex literal of its own.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TYP-001 — MUST:** Define and consume typography through shared tokens, using
  Segoe UI at the size/weight assigned per role; no local font tuples in feature
  code. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TYP-002 — MUST:** Reserve bold for titles, headings, semantic primary
  actions, and intentional active state; regular for body and secondary actions.
  Major app-owned popup titles use the shared 15-point bold dialog title role and
  gold `accent` foreground. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **TYP-003 — MUST:** Draw every ttk label in the font its style declares. The
  application-wide `*Font` option gives every ttk label a widget-level font that
  beats its style, so every heading, dialog title and helper line drew as 10 pt
  regular while the style tables and their tests said 9 pt bold and 15 pt bold.
  `install_ui_styles` MUST hand `TLabel` back to its styles
  (`option_add("*TLabel.font", "")`), and a test MUST measure real labels, because
  reading `style.configure` cannot see the override. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SIZ-001 — MUST:** Give primary and secondary variants of one family the same
  font size, vertical padding, border width, and requested height.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SIZ-002 — MUST:** Let text buttons use content-derived width (explicit char
  width is a minimum), give form controls the shared vertical metric, and give
  fields the shared body font/border/focus/padding. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **SIZ-004 — MUST:** Derive the shared table row height from the body font
  measured at the active Tk scaling, never a literal pixel value. Tk scales the
  font with display scaling and a literal `rowheight` does not follow it, so a
  fixed 28px row left the 150% body linespace exactly as tall as the row that
  held it and Results/Mainboard/Sideboard clipped their own text. Keep at least
  four pixels of headroom over the measured linespace.
  _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.
- **SIZ-003 — MUST:** Display every complete button label without clipping at
  100%, 125%, and 150% — including `Compare`, `Add Mainboard`, and `Add Sideboard`.
  Intentional multiline labels MUST be validated by the widest rendered line,
  and both `Remove from Mainboard` and `Remove from Sideboard` MUST fit their
  comparison side rail at all three simulated Tk scales. The five Card Preview
  actions (Gallery, Legality, Flip, Rotate, Zoom) share the fixed center column,
  so each MUST be content-sized (`width=0`): clam's default minimum of eleven
  characters asked for 465 px of a 442 px row at 100% and dropped Gallery
  entirely at 125%. A size-locked dialog MUST also be at least as large as its
  content asks for (WIN-011), so its footer button is whole at every scale.
  _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.

## Layout and behavior invariants

- **LAY-001 — MUST:** Build the main application shell as three deterministic
  horizontal columns in this order: Search/Results, fixed center, Deck Building.
  The center column MUST use `MAIN_CENTER_COLUMN_WIDTH` (470 px) and MUST NOT expose
  a draggable main-window sash. Search and Deck MUST consume all remaining width
  proportionally using the shared 51/49 weights, with Search slightly wider. The
  center column MUST stack a fixed-height Card Preview above Deck Stats; that split
  MUST NOT be draggable. The Card Preview region MUST use
  `MAIN_CARD_PREVIEW_HEIGHT` (558 px), which leaves its complete 340×480 image box
  and Legality/Rotate/Zoom row visible. Deck Stats consumes all remaining center
  height. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAY-002 — MUST NOT:** Move controls between rows, panes, tabs, or windows
  during a presentation-only task without user approval. _Verification:_ **USER**.
- **LAY-003 — MUST:** Keep Search/Clear and Add Mainboard/Add Sideboard on the
  established Search action row, reserving the right-side deck-add group before the
  left Search/Clear group. The SRCH-047 activity cue MUST be packed after both,
  filling the space between them. Comparison controls MUST NOT live on this row.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAY-004 — MUST:** Place one dedicated default dark `surface` comparison bar, with no gold
  outline/box, in the deck workspace below deck name/Format and above
  Mainboard/Sideboard. It MUST show `COMPARE | N CARDS SELECTED` as one left-aligned
  `Section.TLabel` using the exact same ttk widget/style role and left edge as
  `MAINBOARD | N CARDS`, rather than manually imitating its font/color, plus
  standard-density `Add Selected`, compared-count/manage, `Compare`, and `Clear` controls. The action controls MUST responsively
  wrap from four columns to two columns to one column as pane width requires so
  they never clip at supported display scales. While CMP-016's over-limit alert is
  showing, that same widget MUST carry the `SectionAlert`/`SectionAlertDim` label
  styles, which differ from `Section.TLabel` only in foreground, and its longer
  wording MUST wrap onto a further line rather than clip or widen the pane at
  supported display scales. _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.
- **LAY-005 — MUST:** Preserve deck tabs, the visible New Deck control,
  user-configurable columns and filters, and exactly one user-resizable main-workspace
  sash: the vertical Mainboard/Sideboard divider. Main Search/center/Deck and
  Card Preview/Deck Stats draggable sashes are prohibited. The deck tab bar is
  fixed in height, 34 px at 100% and multiplied by the display scaling, so its
  tabs and the New Deck glyph are never clipped at 125% and above.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAY-006 — MUST:** Lay out primary Card Type filter chips in four columns
  by default and expand to five columns only when the five-column grid's natural
  requested width, plus a headroom margin, fits inside the available Card Type
  frame. Every cell is as wide as the widest chip, so when the four-column grid does
  not fit the row MUST fall back to three columns, then two, rather than cut a
  label such as `Enchantment` or `Planeswalker`; the Supertype chips follow the
  same rule starting from five columns. Uniform columns are equal as columns,
  padding included, so a row's required width is the column count times the widest
  chip plus the widest per-column gap padding; counting the chips alone left a
  middle-column chip one pixel short and cut it. Re-evaluate this presentation-only layout
  as the frame resizes, and after every chip re-render, without recreating filter
  state. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAY-007 — MUST:** Present the primary name label as **Card Name** and let its
  editable field span the remaining Search-form width. Search standard and Advanced
  rows MUST share one primary label rail so every primary control begins at
  the same horizontal position regardless of label length. The rail is 144 pixels at
  100% display scaling, multiplied by the display scaling, and never narrower than
  the widest label of the form: a fixed 144 pixels let `Mana symbols in cost` push
  its control 34 pixels off the shared column at 125%. The `Match` and `Use`
  helper rails scale the same way. Unused space inside that label
  rail MUST carry the Search Style B association cue: a palette-derived two-pixel horizontal
  line with a broad center-weighted fade from the dark surface toward the standard border
  color, begins after a compact text gap, and draws whenever a small usable gap remains.
  The cue MUST NOT move the label or control rails, increase row height, or extend beneath a
  field control. Hovering any standard or Advanced filter row MUST add a subtle
  palette-derived warm-charcoal row-surface tint behind that logical label/control relationship
  and brighten that row's association cue toward the dedicated champagne-gold hover glow. The
  logical row itself MUST NOT receive a light outline. The hover treatment MUST use overlay/style
  changes only and MUST NOT change row geometry. Supertype and Card Type chip controls MUST each
  retain a visible one-pixel border; while their owning row is hovered, each unselected chip MUST
  brighten to the warm-white text color, while a selected chip MUST immediately return to the normal
  border so its gold selected state remains the only selection cue. Secondary relationship rows
  such as Look at, Within/Contains/Exactly, and the mana-symbol threshold MUST share one
  124-pixel mode-label rail before their controls. Any/All/None subrows MUST NOT repeat a
  redundant secondary text label below a primary filter label; they MUST distribute their
  radio controls across the full Search control width in equal-width columns with identical
  inter-option spacing, and each radio widget MUST fill its assigned choice column so Any,
  All, and None have identical clickable widths. Search checklist-dialog mode rows MAY retain
  their explanatory mode label but MUST use the same equal-column radio presentation. Every Search range
  control MUST place its lower field, centered `to` separator, and upper field on the
  same shared 64/30/64-pixel mini-grid; release-year comboboxes and numeric spinboxes
  MUST use those same rails rather than their requested text widths. Power and Toughness
  MUST occupy adjacent primary rows so their lower/separator/upper fields begin on the
  same global rails as Mana Value, Loyalty, Defense, and Released. Every Search picker
  button MUST use the Search-specific picker style whose requested height matches the
  28-pixel form-field height at default Tk scaling, and every picker row MUST stretch
  its picker to the full right edge of the shared Search control area; in particular the
  Advanced Printings picker MUST stretch to the same full Search control-area right edge
  as the other Advanced picker rows. The Advanced Filter Options section button MUST span
  the full width of the Search filter zone (LAY-011), which is the Search pane less its
  scrollbar gutter. A visual-only horizontal boundary MUST separate the filter/Advanced
  region from the Search/Clear/deck-action/Results region without introducing a sash, nested pane,
  fixed geometry, or other window-locking behavior; the scrolling filter zone of LAY-011 is
  none of those. Mana Color, Mana Produced, and Mana Symbols in Cost MUST use the same
  compact left-packed W/U/B/R/G/C choice spacing rather than distributing the choices
  across equal-width columns. While all six do not fit on one line the row MUST wrap
  to two rows of three, then three rows of two, so no colour is ever clipped out of
  reach. Lay out Supertypes in five compact columns, fewer when the widest name does
  not fit (LAY-006). Keep the shared English-only Search criterion in the top-right
  of the Printings popup rather than consuming primary Search-row width.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAY-008 — MUST:** Keep the primary Search rows on one uniform vertical-spacing
  token. Primary Search rows MUST use 2-pixel vertical padding, Advanced rows MUST use
  1-pixel vertical padding, and secondary mode/helper rows MUST use one compact 1-pixel
  top gap. TYPE LINE, Advanced, and Advanced-category headings MUST retain small explicit
  separation so tighter row density does not collapse category hierarchy. Keep Format and
  Rarity in the advanced panel's Printing category, and omit redundant pane titles
  `Card Search`, `Current Deck`, `Card Preview`, and `Deck Stats` while retaining the
  uppercase bold `MAINBOARD` and `SIDEBOARD` section labels. Results MUST present its
  count in that same gold section-heading role as `RESULTS | N CARDS` (transient Search
  states MAY replace the numeric portion while work is pending). Search and
  deck-workspace outer panes and the center Card Preview/Deck Stats panes MUST use
  flat borderless dark surfaces; thin field-style outlines matching Rules Text belong
  to dark secondary buttons rather than workspace containers. Results/Mainboard/Sideboard Treeviews
  MUST NOT inherit the clam theme's light outer `Treeview.field` edge; their outer
  field edge MUST blend into the dark surface. Purposeful field, table-heading,
  scrollbar, separator, and deck-tab boundaries MAY remain. The deterministic main
  shell MUST include visible non-draggable one-pixel dividers between Search/center,
  center/Deck, and Card Preview/Deck Stats so the fixed panes remain visually distinct
  without restoring draggable sashes. Search, Clear, Add Mainboard, and Add
  Sideboard MUST use the standard action density; deck quantity/remove/move controls
  MUST use the enlarged deck-control density. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **LAY-009 — MUST:** Keep Deck Stats below the fixed Card Preview and let it
  consume the center column's remaining height. Omit the old top aggregate strip
  that listed total cards, lands, spells, average mana value, and sideboard count,
  together with its separator. Deck Stats MUST use one outer stats scrollbar rather than
  nested section scrollbars.
  Keep Deck Overview (composition plus color requirements/sources), Mana Curve,
  Opening Hand & Draw Odds (land consistency plus selected-card odds), Sample Hand,
  and Format Legality as clearly separated sections. The Sample Hand table MUST show
  all seven drawn rows and MUST NOT have its own vertical scrollbar; the outer Deck
  Stats canvas provides scrolling when the complete dashboard exceeds available height.
  Format Legality status text MUST state the pass/failure status only and MUST NOT
  append `see Details`; the Details button remains the explicit drill-in action. The
  `BASIC FORMAT CHECK` dialog heading MUST use the same gold accent/dialog-title
  treatment as Mechanics/Subtype picker titles. The mana-source summary MUST put
  `Red colored Sources numbers indicate missing/light mana source support.` on its own
  line directly below the `Mana-producing cards` count. Mana Curve `By type` and `By color`
  legends MUST show numeric totals for every displayed segment.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **LAY-010 — SHOULD:** Present Deck Stats as a polished dashboard: consistent
  dark header bands, gold section titles, and unhurried internal spacing, with
  Land Consistency and Selected Card draw odds labelled in plain language that
  states what each percentage means rather than compressed abbreviations. No
  deterministic check establishes whether spacing reads as polished, so this is
  a judgement the user approves rather than a release blocker under GOV-002.
  LAY-009 keeps the testable structure: section membership, the single outer
  scrollbar, and the seven scrollbar-free Sample Hand rows.
  _Verification:_ **MANUAL**.
- **LAY-011 — MUST:** Keep Search, Clear, Add Mainboard, Add Sideboard and at least
  `RESULTS_MIN_ROWS` (six) Results rows on screen at every window size, however tall
  the filters are. The standard form and the Advanced panel live in one `ScrollZone`
  (`ui/components.py`) above a pinned block that holds the boundary line, the action
  row and the Results table. Tk's packer gives space in pack order, so the pinned
  block MUST be packed BEFORE the zone, and the Results table MUST request exactly
  `RESULTS_MIN_ROWS` rows (`height=RESULTS_MIN_ROWS`): its minimum is then
  guaranteed, it grows with any spare height, and the zone, packed last, asks for its
  natural height and is squeezed only when it has to be. The zone is created before
  the pinned block so Tab visits the filters first. Its scrollbar gutter is ALWAYS
  reserved, so the width of the form never shifts and the chip rows cannot reflow as
  a bar appears; with nothing to scroll the bar is disabled and draws nothing (its own
  idle style paints only the surface), and it draws, gold, only once the content
  overflows. A gap of `ScrollZone.BAR_GAP` (6 px at 100%, scaled with the display) MUST
  separate the controls from the bar so the two never touch. Clicking
  Advanced open MUST scroll the Advanced button to the top of the zone; clicking it
  closed MUST return the zone to its first row; restoring a saved workspace MUST NOT
  move the view. Either move MUST land once: opening waits until the zone has been
  resized for the taller form and then jumps against that size, and closing goes to
  the top before Tk clamps the view; deciding the jump against the old height flashed
  the Advanced button at the top of the pane before it dropped to its place. The wheel over any ttk spinbox or combobox in the zone, such as
  Power or Released, MUST scroll the zone and MUST NOT edit the field. Keyboard focus
  on a control scrolled out of view MUST scroll it into view, and row hover MUST
  count only the visible viewport. A zone scrolled deep whose content then shrinks
  MUST NOT be left blank past the end. Before this rule, opening Advanced pushed
  Search and Results off the pane at every window size tested, and at 1366x768 the
  Results table had no room at all. _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.
- **BEH-001 — MUST:** Preserve every existing command callback, filter function,
  Tk variable, event binding, protocol handler, and search meaning during a
  presentation-only change, comparing manifests with the pre-change source.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **BEH-002 — MUST:** Keep search, DB update, image loading, and print work
  asynchronous, communicating to Tk through existing UI-thread queues and
  `after` callbacks. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **BEH-003 — MUST:** Preserve autocomplete focus, dismissal, keyboard
  navigation, and popup behavior. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BEH-004 — MUST NOT:** Rebuild unrelated panes during deck-session switching,
  and keep table sorting/filtering isolated by view. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BEH-005 — MUST NOT:** Replace a button or filter command to achieve a visual
  effect, or let a presentation-only observer modify feature state.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **BEH-006 — MUST:** Treat every destroyable Tk popup as a bounded lifecycle:
  before or during destruction, invalidate deferred/batched callbacks that can touch
  it and release popup-owned widget caches, variable traces, tooltip registrations,
  and global widget registries. A replacement popup MUST NOT reuse a widget object
  created under an earlier destroyed `Toplevel`. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **BEH-007 — MUST:** Editable Search fields for Rules Text, Mana Value, Power,
  and Toughness MUST behave like Card Name on an outside click: clear transient
  text-selection highlighting and relinquish active focus even when the clicked
  control does not take keyboard focus; the field value itself MUST remain
  unchanged. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

- **BEH-008 — MUST:** When a Rules Text chip is removed, collapse the chip strip
  completely when no chips remain so it cannot retain its previous requested width.
  Reset the editable entry selection, insertion cursor, and horizontal viewport after
  Tk recomputes geometry; clicking a chip close control MUST return editing focus to
  the Rules Text entry. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Data, taxonomy, and printing identity

- **DATA-001 — MUST:** Preserve exact Scryfall printing identity whenever an ID
  is available, and write collector-qualified tags so duplicate/split printings
  do not collapse. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-002 — MUST:** Keep legacy set-only deck tags readable and every stored
  face of a multi-face card searchable. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-003 — MUST:** Keep multi-word subtype phrases atomic in exact Search SQL,
  but expose a Subtype picker value only when it appears in an authoritative
  Scryfall subtype catalog and on at least one row in the current Content/Paper
  scope. Uncataloged type-line words remain queryable by explicit non-UI callers
  but MUST NOT become picker vocabulary. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-004 — MUST:** Derive Search Card Type vocabulary only by intersecting
  Scryfall's `card-types` catalog with authoritative Oracle `type_line` values
  present in the current local Content/Paper scope. Card Type occurrence/search matching
  MUST be phrase-safe and MUST NOT assume an authoritative future Card Type is one word. Missing/failed catalog data
  yields no invented fallback vocabulary; arbitrary novelty/legacy words such as
  subtype text, `Emblem`, or parody type words MUST NOT be promoted to Card Type
  choices. When the authoritative `card-types` catalog itself is unavailable, the
  UI MUST report that the Scryfall Card Type taxonomy is unavailable and direct the
  user to Database > Update Database outside the Card Type chip row, rather than
  presenting the state as a normal empty scope or inline filter-row prose.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-005 — MUST:** Present this filter as **Supertype**. Define no
  hardcoded Supertype picker vocabulary in production taxonomy/filter source.
  Rule-specific domain logic that independently needs a named supertype MUST NOT
  authorize or populate this picker. Discover the current Comprehensive
  Rules TXT from the official Wizards Rules page, locate the uniquely numbered
  `Supertypes` section structurally, strictly extract its complete first lettered
  subrule enumeration without fuzzy guessing, persist the verified values plus
  source URL/document hash/provenance, and intersect those values only with
  authoritative Oracle `type_line` values present in the current local
  Content/Paper scope. Supertype occurrence/search matching MUST be phrase-safe and
  MUST NOT assume an official future Supertype is one word. Scryfall's broader `supertypes` catalog MUST NOT authorize
  this picker. If Rules discovery/parsing fails, retain the previous verified
  vocabulary; with no previous verified vocabulary, expose no Supertype choices.
  Derive Mechanics from observed card `keywords` intersected with Scryfall's keyword-ability,
  keyword-action, and ability-word catalogs. Every selectable value MUST occur on
  at least one currently scoped local row; missing/failed catalogs yield no
  invented fallback vocabulary. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-008 — MUST:** Derive Search Content only as Cards, Tokens, Emblems, and Art Series from Scryfall-backed row/layout semantics. Present these four existing choices in **Search Scope**, not as Card Traits. All four independently select a content kind rather than adding a trait clause; Cards defaults on, Tokens/Emblems/Art Series default off, and an empty selection falls back to Cards. Changing Search Scope MUST rebuild trusted vocabulary for that scope. Art Series uses the internal `art` key and explicit selection overrides the legacy hidden-art exclusion. Unknown future layouts remain importable/Search-visible under Cards while internally diagnosed as unknown; do not invent a Supplemental bucket or infer new content classes. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-009 — MUST:** Derive Formats, Rarities, Set Types, and Exact Sets only
  from values observed in the current local Scryfall snapshot and current
  Content/Paper scope. Format picker membership MUST come directly from locally
  observed Scryfall `legalities` keys whose status is playable (`legal` or
  `restricted`); unknown future legality statuses MUST be preserved and diagnosed
  but MUST NOT be assumed playable; production source MUST NOT define a preferred or allowed Format
  vocabulary, and deterministic display ordering MUST NOT invent membership. Set
  Type and Exact Set remain independent optional Search criteria that intersect
  when both are selected, but the Exact Set picker vocabulary MUST cascade from
  the current Content/Paper scope plus the selected observed Set Types (or all
  observed Set Types when none are selected). Changing Content, Paper-only, or Set
  Type MUST refresh that picker in place without destroying/reopening the Printings
  popup; compatible Exact Set selections MUST survive and newly ineligible Exact
  Set selections MUST be removed. Art-Series-only Content MUST expose only locally
  observed Art Series Set Types/Exact Sets, while Cards + Art Series MUST expose
  their union. Recommended-set defaults, product families, and
  grouped set taxonomies MUST NOT affect Search results. These Printings controls
  belong to interactive Search only; deck TXT import MUST remain independent of
  their state and resolve against the complete local card database.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-010 — MUST:** Store the complete Scryfall `games` list and offer Paper,
  Arena, and MTGO as a `PRINTING TYPE` section of the shared Printings picker,
  laid out horizontally on one row. A printing matches when it is available on
  any selected platform; selecting none or all is no restriction. Default
  interactive Search to every platform (Paper, Arena, and MTGO, which is no
  platform restriction) with no Set Type or Exact Set restriction, and `Clear`
  MUST restore that same all-platform default. The
  `paper_only` taxonomy scope is derived from that selection rather than set
  directly, so vocabulary scoping stays in step with the visible controls; a
  single boolean could only say "paper" or "everything" and could never name
  Arena or MTGO. The selected platforms MUST also form part of the trusted
  taxonomy cache key and be passed to the scoped vocabulary queries behind it.
  Every scoped vocabulary query takes it: sets, set types, layouts, formats and
  release years, and also Card Types, Supertypes, Subtypes, Mechanics and Rarities
  (which once ignored it, so Arena-only still listed paper-only types).
  Paper, Arena and MTGO print different sets, so a snapshot loaded for one
  platform describes vocabulary the others do not have; leaving platform out
  of the key let a paper snapshot arrive after an Arena toggle and silently
  overwrite the Arena set list the toggle had just produced.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-006 — MUST:** Preserve both B.F.M. physical printings and their
  reconstructed type data. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-007 — MUST:** Use exact JSON membership (not substring) where stored
  data represents a collection, and deduplicate display values
  case-insensitively without altering stored source values.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-011 — MUST:** Distinguish forbidden value whitelists from allowed semantic
  hard-coding. Card Type/Supertype/Subtype/Mechanic/Format/Set/Set-Type/Rarity
  membership MUST remain authority/data-driven. Stable application semantics such as
  WUBRG, Cards/Tokens/Emblems/Art Series, known legality meanings, known layout meanings, deck
  rules, defaults, and preferred ordering MAY be explicit when unknown upstream
  values remain importable and are never silently discarded. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **DATA-012 — MUST:** After trusted catalog/card refreshes, maintain an internal
  upstream compatibility fingerprint/report covering observed layouts, legality
  statuses, dynamic taxonomy and authority gaps. New structural concepts MUST be
  preserved and diagnosed rather than guessed; diagnostics MUST NOT fail or roll back
  a successful card refresh, alter picker membership, or create normal-user UI clutter.
  Recognized catalog endpoints MUST come from the declarative authority registry;
  production MUST NOT crawl or auto-interpret arbitrary future catalog endpoints.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Portability, storage, and Windows builds

- **PORT-001 — MUST:** Store automatic runtime data only in the local `data`
  directory beside the source tree or packaged executable; no AppData, home,
  registry, or Temp fallback. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PORT-002 — MUST:** Fail startup with a clear error when the application
  directory is not writable. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PORT-003 — MUST:** Replace Scryfall bulk data atomically and commit only
  after strict parse/download integrity checks plus the distinct-card threshold
  pass, so interrupted, truncated, corrupt, or duplicate-only input cannot replace
  the previous database. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PORT-004 — MUST:** Build the Windows application as PyInstaller ONEDIR; never
  one-file. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PORT-005 — MAY:** Read/write a path the user explicitly selects for Open,
  Save, or Export. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **PORT-007 — MUST:** Write every persisted application file through one
  durable replace pattern: a unique temporary name from `tempfile.mkstemp` in
  the destination directory, `flush` and `fsync` before closing, `os.replace`
  onto the final path, and unconditional temporary cleanup. A fixed temporary
  filename lets two writers interleave into one path, and omitting `fsync` lets
  the rename become visible before the bytes it points at, publishing an empty
  file that a tolerant reader silently treats as "no saved settings". Governs
  `workspace/repository.py`, `preferences/repository.py`, `deck/io.py`, and
  `printing/renderer.py`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **PORT-006 — MUST:** Preserve the Windows named-mutex single-instance guard.
  `acquire_single_instance` MUST be detection-only: it reports whether this
  process claimed the mutex and MUST NOT display a dialog or otherwise block.
  The already-running notice belongs to `notify_already_running`, called from
  `main`, so an automated, headless, or packaged-smoke caller observes a
  refusal instead of hanging forever on a modal dialog nothing can dismiss.
  _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.
- **BLD-001 — MUST:** Keep `pyproject.toml` as the only dependency manifest, with
  runtime deps in `[project].dependencies` and PyInstaller in
  `[project.optional-dependencies].build`; never create `requirements.txt`.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BLD-002 — MUST:** Discover the `mtgdb` package in `pyproject.toml` and keep
  `ProxicDeckBuilder.spec` as the authoritative ONEDIR layout and asset list, with
  `mtgdb/main.py` as the entry script. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BLD-003 — MUST:** Update `pyproject.toml`, `build_windows.bat`, and the
  GitHub workflow together when dependency or entry behavior changes.
  _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **BLD-004 — MUST:** Run compilation, every cross-platform test, the Windows
  simulated-Tk-scaling geometry test at 100/125/150%, the single-instance test,
  and the full `DeckBuilderApp` startup smoke test before a Windows build
  succeeds, then run the packaged smoke test after PyInstaller; a smoke failure
  fails the build and blocks cloud upload.
  The geometry gate does not certify Windows OS or per-monitor DPI behavior.
  It is a local-build gate: the headless cloud runner (`GITHUB_ACTIONS`) skips
  it because its DPI/font environment is not representative, while every local
  build path (`build_windows.bat`, `package_release.py`) still runs it at all
  three scales.
  _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.
- **BLD-007 — MUST:** Ship the packaged build as the program only. The
  packaged smoke test MUST remove `dist/ProxicDeckBuilder/data` after it runs and
  the cloud artifact step MUST exclude that directory, so no card database,
  cached image, log, or saved workspace session is ever published inside the
  application artifact. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BLD-008 — MUST:** Keep the packaged smoke test hermetic. Seed a database the
  sync service already considers current so launching the packaged app performs
  no network refresh, and fail the test if a bulk download begins. A smoke test
  that downloads the full Scryfall export makes every build slow, network
  dependent, and unable to run offline. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BLD-009 — MUST:** Give the built `.exe` Windows version metadata whose
  `FileVersion`/`ProductVersion` are read from `pyproject.toml` at build time,
  so the shipped binary identifies its own version and cannot drift from the
  manifest. Keep UPX compression disabled. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BLD-005 — MUST:** Remove generated `*.egg-info` metadata after dependency
  install and before guardrails run. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BLD-006 — MUST:** Require Python 3.11 or newer in `pyproject.toml` and local
  build instructions, and keep CI on a Python version satisfying that minimum.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **BLD-010 — MUST:** Rebuild `build-venv` from scratch on every local build, and
  stop the build when it cannot be removed rather than continuing against the
  environment that survived. `rmdir` prints "Access is denied" and carries on
  when a file is locked — usually a `python.exe` started from that folder and
  still running — which left the previous environment in place and built
  against it silently, defeating the reason it is removed at all. The failure
  message MUST name what is holding the folder. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.

## Verification and release enforcement

- **VER-001 — MUST:** Run
  `python -m compileall -q mtgdb tests windows_tests package_release.py` before
  delivering code. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-002 — MUST:** Run every `tests/test_*.py` file directly before delivering
  code or creating a source release. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-014 — MUST:** Run every `windows_tests/test_*.py` file before
  delivering code on Windows. VER-002 covers only the cross-platform suite and
  BLD-004 runs the Windows gates during a build, so code delivered without a
  build otherwise reaches the user with the single-instance, simulated-scaling
  geometry, and startup gates never executed on the one platform this
  application targets. `windows_tests/smoke_packaged_windows.py` requires a
  completed PyInstaller output and remains a BLD-004 build gate.
  _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.
- **VER-003 — MUST:** Run `tests/test_ui_component_contract.py` after a shared
  component or ownership change. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-004 — MUST:** Run `tests/test_ui_visual_contract.py` and
  `tests/test_ui_rendering_contract.py` after a UI token, style, component, or
  layout change. The first reads style definitions and source; the second measures
  what real widgets draw, which is where the label-font override hid.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-005 — MUST:** Run `tests/test_project_guardrails.py` after changing this
  file, dependency metadata, build orchestration, tests, or packaging.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-010 — MUST:** Verify a computed value against an independent expected
  value: a literal, or a closed form written out in the test. A gate MUST NOT
  compare the result of the function under test against another call to that
  same function, because both sides then move together and the assertion passes
  for every possible defect. This is how an off-by-one in the opening-hand
  probability summation survived a check labelled "probability calculations
  retain exact formulas". _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **VER-011 — MUST:** Remove every temporary directory a test creates, using
  `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` or a registered cleanup for the bare
  `tempfile.mkdtemp` form. The suite runs on every local build, every cloud
  build, and every source release, so an unmanaged directory leaks a database
  per run. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-012 — MUST:** Gate each validation guard with adversarial input, not
  only with its happy path. A guard that no test attempts to defeat can be
  deleted without any gate objecting; the card-search projection allow-list,
  which is the only barrier between caller-supplied column names and the
  interpolated `SELECT` list, MUST be exercised with rejected input.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-009 — MUST:** Keep `tests/taxonomy_audit.py --current` capable of
  discovering Scryfall's current `default_cards` bulk export from `/bulk-data`,
  refreshing every trusted Scryfall catalog plus the current official Wizards
  Comprehensive Rules Supertype taxonomy, auditing the full snapshot, and
  emitting a Markdown evidence report. This rule governs the script's contract
  only, which `tests/test_taxonomy_audit_contract.py` checks without network
  access. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-013 — MUST:** Treat an actual full upstream taxonomy audit as evidence
  only when `tests/taxonomy_audit.py --current` really ran through the
  scheduled or manual `taxonomy-audit.yml` workflow. That run downloads the
  complete upstream dataset and is deliberately outside the local and cloud
  release gates, so passing VER-009 is never evidence that the audit itself
  happened. _Verification:_ **USER**.
- **VER-015 — MUST:** Make each scheduled upstream check tell the repository
  owner when it fails or has news, through one deduplicated GitHub issue that is
  assigned to and mentions the owner, because an assignment or mention is what
  GitHub always emails whatever the owner's watch settings are, where a bare
  issue from the Actions bot is emailed only to people watching every issue.
  `taxonomy-audit.yml` MUST do so for any failure of its job, whether the audit
  found drift or the run never finished. No workflow here watches the game
  engine Arena runs: what Arena plays is Arena's to publish (DECK-012, ARN-015),
  so an engine update on Arena needs no Deck Builder release. The workflow MUST NOT rewrite a source file or open a
  pull request: it reports.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **VER-006 — MUST:** Run the Windows simulated-Tk-scaling geometry test at
  100/125/150% after a control, font, spacing, or layout change; report it only as
  Tk geometry coverage, not OS/per-monitor DPI certification.
  _Verification:_ **WINDOWS**.
- **VER-007 — MUST:** Manually inspect every affected screen on Windows after a
  visual change whose behavior cannot be established by geometry and contract
  tests. _Verification:_ **MANUAL**.
- **VER-008 — MUST:** Report each unexecuted Windows or manual check as
  unexecuted; never imply full visual certification. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
- **REL-001 — MUST:** Create source releases only with
  `python package_release.py <output.zip>` from the project root, which runs
  compilation and every cross-platform test before writing or replacing an
  archive and exits nonzero on any failed mandatory gate before the target is
  replaced. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **REL-002 — MUST:** Include source (`mtgdb/`), build config, assets, tests,
  `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `LICENSE`, `AGENTS.md`, and
  `README.md` in a source release, with `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` the only
  documentation members (`LICENSE` is the license grant, not documentation).
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **REL-003 — MUST NOT:** Include `requirements.txt`, a documentation file other
  than `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`, `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, `.pytest_cache`,
  `build`, `dist`, `build-venv`, local `data`, logs, databases, cached images,
  generated PDFs, or another ZIP. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **REL-007 — MUST:** Enforce a membership ceiling as well as a floor.
  `REQUIRED_RELEASE_MEMBERS` proves a release is complete; it does not prove it
  is clean. `package_release.py` MUST additionally reject any root-level file
  outside `ALLOWED_ROOT_FILES` and any member outside
  `ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_DIRECTORIES`, so a scratch or debug script left in the
  project root cannot ship. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **REL-004 — MUST:** Test the completed ZIP for corruption, require its members
  to exactly equal the computed source-release member set, and use the stable
  `Proxic_Deck_Builder/` archive root before replacing the requested output path.
  _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **REL-005 — MUST:** Keep all Windows build and smoke gates before the cloud
  artifact-upload step and make every gate release-blocking. _Verification:_ **AUTO**.
- **REL-006 — MUST:** Finish a task only after confirming the owning-module
  boundary, regression coverage, behavior preservation, truthful test status,
  single-document policy, and release-gate result. _Verification:_ **REVIEW**.
